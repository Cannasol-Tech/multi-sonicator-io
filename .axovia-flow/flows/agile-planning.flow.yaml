# Agile Planning YAML Reference (/agile-planning-yaml)

The following YAML mirrors the AIGILE planning workflow for portability and documentation. Windsurf executes `.md` workflows, not `.yaml` files.

```yaml
name: Agile Planning
slug: agilebooster-planning
description: Generate feature specifications and user stories from an implementation plan and PRD
inputs:
  implementation_plan_path:
    type: string
    default: docs/planning/implementation-plan.md
  prd_path:
    type: string
    default: docs/requirements/PRD-v1.0.0.md
  project_name:
    type: string
    default: <your-project-name>
steps:
  - id: phase1_open
    name: Phase 1 - Open Inputs
    action: prompt
    prompt: |
      Open and review:
      - {{inputs.implementation_plan_path}}
      - {{inputs.prd_path}}

  - id: phase1_confirm
    name: Phase 1 - Confirm Sources
    action: question
    prompt: >
      I think we have everything we need to move to Phase 2 of the Planning Process.
      Are the two files I have "{{inputs.implementation_plan_path}}" and "{{inputs.prd_path}}"
      the correct, up to date, official documents for the "{{inputs.project_name}}" project?
    on_answer:
      yes: next: phase2_analyze
      no: next: phase1_open
      other: next: phase1_confirm

  - id: phase2_analyze
    name: Phase 2 - Analyze PRD and Plan
    action: prompt
    prompt: |
      Converse to fully understand the PRD and Implementation Plan.
      Produce a numbered list of features and a brief description for each.

  - id: phase2_verify_feature
    name: Phase 2 - Verify Understanding (per feature)
    action: question
    prompt: >
      I think I have a clear understanding of the project and the features to be implemented:
      (List features + brief descriptions). Is my understanding correct?

    name: Phase 3 - Approve Feature Specs (per feature)
    action: question
    prompt: >
      I have generated the Feature Specifications for each Feature agreed upon in Phase #2.
      Are these accurate, complete, and ready to move into the backlog for sprint planning?
    on_answer:
      yes:
        next_if_last: phase4_generate_stories

- Windsurf executes Markdown workflows with optional YAML frontmatter; this YAML is for reference only.
- Use `/new-agile-workflow` to run the executable checklist version in this repository.
