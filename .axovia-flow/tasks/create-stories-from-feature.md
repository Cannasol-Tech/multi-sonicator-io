# Create Stories From Feature Task

Purpose

- Generate high‑quality, traceable user stories from a Feature Specification, aligned with Axovia standards and ready for planning/sprint intake.

Pre‑requisites

- Locate the Feature Specification in `docs/agile/features/` to transform.
- Ensure access to story template: `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`.
- Ensure company standards are available: `.axovia-flow/company-standards/*`.

Execution Rules

- Interactive: confirm each major section before proceeding.
- One responsibility per story; avoid mixed concerns.
- Preserve traceability: reference Feature ID and PRD where applicable.

1) Load & Validate Feature Spec

- Identify target spec file (name: `FEATURE-{ID}-{name-kebab-case}.md`).
- Validate it conforms to the Feature Specification Standard.
- Extract: Feature ID, Name, Scope (in/out), Acceptance Criteria, Dependencies.

2) Story Breakdown Strategy

- Map feature scope into story candidates by user‑facing value slices.
- Keep vertical slices; avoid backend‑only stories unless necessary.
- Define a minimal walking skeleton if greenfield.

3) Produce Stories (Iterative)
For each story candidate:

- Title: concise value statement.
- As a/ I want/ So that (user story format).
- Acceptance Criteria: Gherkin‑style or bullet measurable outcomes.
- Dependencies: list upstream stories or external deps.
- Estimation Placeholder: to be refined by team.
- Traceability: include Feature ID and relevant PRD references.

4) Use Story Template

- Use `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` as the content scaffold for each story.
- Save stories under `docs/agile/stories/` using: `STORY-{epic_id}.{story_id}-{story_name_kebab}.md`

5) Validation & Quality Gates

- Completeness: Does each story have acceptance criteria and traceability?
- Independence: Can it be delivered independently where possible?
- Measurability: Are outcomes testable and unambiguous?
- Compliance: Follows standards in `.axovia-flow/company-standards/`.

6) Output & Handoff

- Summarize created stories with links, IDs, and dependencies.
- Notify planning owners or update the planning Sync Prompt table if used.

Test Plan

- Spot‑check 1–2 stories for completeness and alignment to scope.
- Verify references to Feature ID and any PRD anchors.
- If CI supports docs checks, run them before submitting.

Deliverables

- 3–10 user stories in `docs/agile/stories/` covering the feature scope.
- A short summary block appended to the Feature Spec listing new stories.
