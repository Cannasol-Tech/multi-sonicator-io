# Axovia File Header Standard

This standard defines a single, consistent metadata header format that agents and humans can rely on. It applies across Markdown, configuration files, code files, scripts, and CI/workflows. Headers are small, high-signal, lint-safe, and optimized for agent discoverability.

## Required fields (all file types)

- file: Relative path to the file
- title: Human-readable title
- author: Primary author
- company: Axovia AI
- date: YYYY-MM-DD
- brief: 1–2 sentence overview of the document
- version: Semantic version (e.g., 1.0)

Optional (use where it adds value):

- dependencies: List of external files this document depends on
- commands: Actions agents/users can run (Axovia tasks or Make targets)
- tags: Topical tags for retrieval (e.g., qa, bdd, architecture)

Notes:

- Keep headers lint-safe (blank lines around lists and fenced blocks).
- Use relative paths in file and dependencies.file.
- Keep the provenance banner line for consistent agent indexing.

---

## Markdown (primary docs)

Use YAML-style frontmatter at the top.

Example:
```markdown

# <!-- Generated by Axovia Flow™ Agentic Framework -->
file: docs/architecture/README.md
title: Architecture Overview
author: Jane Doe
company: Axovia AI
date: 2025-09-11
brief: High-level architectural context and constraints for the project.
version: 1.0
dependencies:
  - file: ../../.axovia-flow/flow-config.yaml
    type: flow-config
    required: true
    description: Axovia Flow configuration
commands:
  - generate_cicd:
      type: task
      flowFile: ../../.axovia-flow/flows/generate-cicd.yaml
      description: Generate CI workflow file
      options:
        - --python_version 3.11
        - --node_version 18

  - `make validate-headers`
    description: Validate Markdown headers against standard

---
```

Lint tips:

- Ensure blank lines around lists and fenced code blocks.
- Use explicit language fences (for example, ```yaml, ```bash).

---

## YAML (config)

Use a top comment block that does not affect parsing.

Example:
```yaml
# <!-- Generated by Axovia Flow™ Agentic Framework -->
# file: .axovia-flow/config/services.yaml
# title: Services Configuration
# author: Jane Doe
# company: Axovia AI
# date: 2025-09-11
# brief: Canonical services configuration for Axovia agents
# version: 1.0

services:
  mcp_server:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8000
    log_level: INFO
    shutdown_timeout: 30
```

If schema/version are part of the config semantics, keep those in the YAML structure, not the header comments.

---

## JSON

Prefer not to bloat semantic config. If metadata is needed in-file, use a lightweight `_header` object (optional) or store metadata in a registry.

Example:
```json
{
  "_header": {
    "file": "schemas/json/services.schema.json",
    "title": "Services Schema",
    "author": "Jane Doe",
    "company": "Axovia AI",
    "date": "2025-09-11",
    "brief": "JSON Schema for services.yaml",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "Services",
  "type": "object"
}
```

---

## XML

Use a comment header.

Example:
```xml
<!--
  Generated by Axovia Flow™ Agentic Framework
  file: schemas/xml/example.xml
  title: Example Schema
  author: Jane Doe
  company: Axovia AI
  date: 2025-09-11
  brief: Example XML schema
  version: 1.0
-->
<root/>
```

---

## Code files (Doxygen/JSDoc-compatible)

Use language-appropriate docblocks.

C-like (C/C++/Java/JS/TS):
```c
/**
 * Generated by Axovia Flow™ Agentic Framework
 * @file src/module/example.c
 * @title Example C Module
 * @author Jane Doe
 * @company Axovia AI
 * @date 2025-09-11
 * @brief Example module with metadata header
 * @version 1.0
 */
```

Python:
```python
"""

title: Example Python Module

```

Shell:
```bash

#>
```

---

## CI/Workflows (YAML)

Use a comment header at the top of workflow files.

```yaml
# Generated by Axovia Flow™ Agentic Framework
# file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
# title: Continuous Integration
# author: Jane Doe
# company: Axovia AI
# date: 2025-09-11
# brief: Axovia standard validator pipeline
# version: 1.0

name: Continuous Integration
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

---

## Versioning & maintenance

- Update `version` when the document’s purpose/structure changes materially.
- Keep `date` current for major edits.
- Prefer small, composable templates for reuse; add shared partials (for example, provenance) later if desired.

---

## Validation

Use the header validator (Makefile target `validate-headers`) to ensure required keys exist on Markdown frontmatter:

- `file`, `title`, `author`, `company`, `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `brief`, `version`
- Optional keys can be included as needed.
