# Feature #1: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence

**Feature ID**: 001
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Critical  
**Epic**: Epic 0: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence  
**Owner**: Product Owner (Sarah)  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Feature Summary

Establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and ensure complete adherence to company release standards, creating the foundational infrastructure for reliable firmware development and quality assurance for the Multi-Sonicator-IO project.

## Scope Definition

### EXACTLY What Will Be Implemented

- PlatformIO project structure following company standards
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated build, test, and quality checks
- Unity Test Framework integration with 85% coverage requirement enforcement
- Make targets per company testing standards (`make test-unit`, `make test-acceptance`)
- Doxygen documentation generation with automated builds
- Release report generation following company release format standards
- Code quality enforcement (linting, static analysis, coding style compliance)
- Automated test execution and reporting infrastructure
- Version control hooks and branch protection rules
- Build artifact management and release packaging

### EXACTLY What Will NOT Be Implemented

- Actual firmware functionality (handled in subsequent epics)
- Hardware-specific testing (covered in Epic 1)
- Multi-sonicator logic (covered in Epic 3)
- Safety feature implementation (covered in Epic 4)
- Production deployment automation (covered in Epic 5)
- Manual testing procedures (automated testing only)
- Custom testing frameworks (Unity Test Framework only)
- Non-standard documentation formats (Doxygen only)

### Scope Boundaries

- **Start**: Empty repository setup
- **Stop**: Fully functional CI/CD pipeline ready for firmware development
- **Includes**: All development infrastructure and quality gates
- **Excludes**: Any domain-specific firmware code or hardware interactions

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. Initialize PlatformIO project with Arduino framework for ATmega32A
2. Configure GitHub Actions workflow with build/test/deploy stages
3. Integrate Unity Test Framework with coverage reporting
4. Implement make targets: `make test-unit`, `make test-acceptance`, `make build`, `make clean`
5. Configure Doxygen for automated documentation generation
6. Set up release report generation per company standards
7. Enforce code quality through automated linting and static analysis

### User Interactions

#### Developer Code Commit
**User Action**: Developer commits code to repository
**System Response**: CI pipeline automatically triggers build and test sequence
**Expected Outcome**: Build status reported, tests executed, quality checks performed

#### Unit Test Execution
**User Action**: Developer runs `make test-unit`
**System Response**: Unity Test Framework executes all unit tests with coverage analysis
**Expected Outcome**: Test results displayed with coverage report showing ≥85% coverage

#### Build Process
**User Action**: Developer runs `make build`
**System Response**: PlatformIO builds project with quality checks
**Expected Outcome**: Successful build with quality validation or clear error messages

### System Behaviors

- Automatic build on every commit to main branch
- Test failure blocks merge to main branch
- Coverage below 85% fails CI pipeline
- Documentation auto-generates on successful builds
- Release packages created automatically on version tags

### Data Handling

- Test results stored in standardized reports
- Coverage data tracked and reported in company format
- Build artifacts versioned and stored with proper metadata
- Documentation published to project documentation site

### Integration Points

- GitHub repository and GitHub Actions
- PlatformIO build system and toolchain
- Unity Test Framework for C/C++ testing
- Doxygen documentation generation system
- Company standards compliance checking tools

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria (Must Have)

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline executes successfully on every commit
- [ ] Unit test coverage reports show ≥85% statement coverage
- [ ] All make targets execute without errors
- [ ] Doxygen documentation generates complete API docs
- [ ] Release reports follow company format exactly
- [ ] Code quality checks pass (linting, static analysis)
- [ ] Build artifacts are properly versioned and stored

### Secondary Acceptance Criteria (Should Have)

- [ ] Pipeline execution time <5 minutes for standard builds
- [ ] Test reports display coverage metrics clearly
- [ ] Documentation is accessible and properly formatted
- [ ] Release packages include all required components

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All company testing standards implemented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational and tested
- [ ] Documentation generation working
- [ ] Quality gates enforcing standards
- [ ] Ready for firmware development (Epic 1)

## Testing Requirements

### Test Scenarios

#### Test Scenario 1: Successful Build Pipeline
**Given**: Valid code committed to repository
**When**: CI pipeline executes
**Then**: Build succeeds, tests pass, documentation generates

#### Test Scenario 2: Test Failure Handling
**Given**: Code with failing tests committed
**When**: CI pipeline executes
**Then**: Pipeline fails, merge blocked, clear error messages provided

#### Test Scenario 3: Coverage Enforcement
**Given**: Code with <85% test coverage
**When**: CI pipeline executes
**Then**: Build fails with coverage report showing deficiency

### Edge Case Testing

- Empty repository initialization
- Large commit handling
- Concurrent build execution
- Network failure during build

### Error Condition Testing

- Invalid PlatformIO configuration
- Missing dependencies
- Documentation generation failures
- Release packaging errors

## Implementation Mapping

### Related PRD Requirements

- **NFR6**: 90% unit test coverage using Unity Test Framework
- **NFR7**: Automated acceptance tests (simulation and/or HIL)
- **NFR4**: Doxygen-style comments for all public functions
- **Technical Assumptions**: Arduino framework via PlatformIO, GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Implementing User Stories

- **Story 0.1**: Project Structure & Standards Compliance
- **Story 0.2**: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
