# Agile Overview Files Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of all files related to displaying and managing the agile overview for the Multi-Sonicator I/O project. The agile overview encompasses project dashboards, epic and story tracking, quality assurance metrics, and related documentation that provides visibility into project progress, dependencies, and health.

The agile overview is primarily displayed through dashboard files that aggregate data from various sources, providing stakeholders with real-time insights into project status, critical paths, and quality metrics.

## Core Dashboard Files

### Project Board Dashboard (`docs/agile/project-board.md`)

**Purpose**: Primary executive-level dashboard providing a high-level view of project progress across all epics and stories.

**Key Features**:
- Executive summary with project health status
- Epic progress overview table
- Detailed story status matrices for each epic
- Critical path analysis and blocking issues
- Immediate action items with priorities
- Quality metrics dashboard (test coverage, QA gates)
- Development team focus areas by sprint
- File organization and update schedule

**Content Structure**:
- Project completion percentage and story counts
- Epic-level progress tracking
- Story-level status with QA gate results
- Dependency chain health analysis
- Sprint planning and focus areas

**Update Frequency**: Daily during active sprints, weekly during planning cycles, after story completion or QA reviews.

### Story Status Dashboard (`docs/agile/stories/STORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`)

**Purpose**: Detailed story-level dashboard providing granular visibility into individual story progress and status.

**Key Features**:
- Identical content structure to project-board.md but with additional metadata
- Frontmatter with Axovia Flow™ provenance tags
- Story-specific progress tracking
- QA gate integration
- Dependency management

**Content Structure**:
- Same executive summary and epic progress as project-board.md
- Enhanced with story-specific blocking issues

- All files include update timestamps and version information

### Quality Standards

- Test coverage targets (≥90% for unit tests)
- QA gate criteria (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)
- Documentation completeness requirements
- Traceability compliance

### Automation Support

- Scripts in `scripts/` directory support dashboard generation and updates
