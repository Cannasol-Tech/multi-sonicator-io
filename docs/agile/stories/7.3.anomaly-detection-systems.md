# Story 7.3: Anomaly Detection Systems Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-7.3
**Epic**: Epic 7: Predictive Maintenance & Optimization
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: AI/ML Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want real-time anomaly detection and early warning capabilities,
So that I can quickly identify and respond to abnormal system behavior before it leads to failures.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing monitoring systems, alerting infrastructure, and predictive analytics
- Technology: Anomaly detection algorithms, real-time processing, alerting mechanisms
- Follows pattern: Real-time pattern recognition with low false positive rates
- Touch points: Sensor readings, performance metrics, alert systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Real-time anomaly detection with <5% false positive rate
2. Early warning alerts with 95% true positive detection
3. Multi-dimensional anomaly analysis across all system metrics
4. Real-time alert delivery with <60 second response time
5. Anomaly classification with severity levels and root cause indicators

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New detection follows established alerting patterns and protocols
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Detection works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Detection accuracy >95% with <5% false positive rate
11. Alert delivery time <60 seconds for all anomalies
12. No regression in existing monitoring functionality
13. Detection systems follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing monitoring infrastructure with anomaly detection capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Monitoring and alerting from Story 5.3
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within real-time processing and computational limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Anomaly detection systems operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with detection procedures and alert management
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Alert fatigue from excessive false positives or missed anomalies
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent filtering and adaptive thresholding
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic monitoring with manual anomaly detection

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing monitoring systems
- [ ] Detection works with current sensor and data processing configurations
- [ ] Real-time processing doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Alerts generated in standard formats for notification systems
