# Story 0.2: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**Story ID**: S-0.2
**Feature**: F-001: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: Product Owner (Sarah)
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** firmware developer,
**I want** a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and validates every commit,
**so that** I can ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and enable reliable automated releases.

## Feature Context

**Feature F-001: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence**

- Goal: Establish comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and ensure complete adherence to company release standards
- Creates foundational infrastructure for reliable firmware development and quality assurance

## Story Context

**CI/CD Pipeline Infrastructure:**

- GitHub Actions workflow automation
- PlatformIO build system integration
- Automated testing execution and reporting
- Build caching and optimization

**Integration Points:**

- GitHub repository and Actions
- PlatformIO build toolchain
- Unity Test Framework execution
- Coverage reporting and quality gates

## Acceptance Criteria

**Pipeline Automation Requirements:**

1. GitHub Actions workflow triggers on every commit to main and feature branches
2. PlatformIO build process executes successfully with proper ATmega32A target configuration
3. Pipeline caches dependencies and build artifacts for optimal performance (<5 minutes total execution)
4. All unit tests execute automatically via `make test-unit` with results reported

**Quality Gate Requirements:**

5. Test failures prevent merge to main branch with clear failure reporting
6. Code coverage reports generated and published with ≥85% coverage enforcement
7. Build artifacts properly versioned and stored with metadata
8. Pipeline status clearly visible in GitHub pull request checks

**Performance Requirements:**

9. Standard build pipeline completes in <5 minutes
10. Cached builds execute in <2 minutes for incremental changes
11. Test execution provides detailed timing and resource utilization reports
12. Pipeline failure notifications provide actionable debugging information

## Technical Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Cache PlatformIO
        uses: actions/cache@v3
      - name: Set up PlatformIO
      - name: Build firmware
        run: make build
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: make test-unit
      - name: Generate coverage report
      - name: Upload artifacts
```

### Required CI Make Targets

```bash
make ci              # Complete CI pipeline locally
make build          # Build firmware with quality checks
make test-unit      # Execute unit tests with coverage
make upload-artifacts # Package build artifacts
```

### Quality Reporting

- Coverage reports in HTML and XML formats
- Test execution results with detailed timing
- Build artifact inventory with checksums
- Quality metrics dashboard integration

## Dev Notes

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Key Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Ubuntu latest with PlatformIO installation
2. **Dependency Caching**: PlatformIO packages and build dependencies
3. **Build Stage**: Firmware compilation with quality checks
4. **Test Stage**: Unit test execution with coverage analysis
5. **Artifact Stage**: Build artifact packaging and storage

**Performance Optimization:**
- PlatformIO dependency caching
- Build artifact caching between runs
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Optimized container images

### Testing Standards

**Test File Location:** `test/unit/test_ci_pipeline.cpp`

**Testing Framework:** Unity Test Framework

**Testing Requirements:**
- Validate CI pipeline execution
- Test build artifact integrity
- Verify coverage reporting accuracy
