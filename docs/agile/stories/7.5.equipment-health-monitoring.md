# Story 7.5: Equipment Health Monitoring Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-7.5
**Epic**: Epic 7: Predictive Maintenance & Optimization
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Reliability Engineer
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a reliability engineer,
I want health scoring and degradation analysis capabilities,
So that I can track equipment condition and plan maintenance proactively.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing monitoring systems, predictive models, and maintenance workflows
- Technology: Health scoring algorithms, degradation analysis, trend monitoring
- Follows pattern: Condition-based monitoring with health indicators
- Touch points: Sensor data, performance metrics, maintenance records

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Equipment health scoring with accurate condition assessment
2. Degradation trend analysis with predictive modeling
3. Health indicator visualization with historical tracking
4. Condition-based maintenance triggers with threshold alerts
5. Component-level health assessment with failure mode analysis

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New health monitoring follows established condition monitoring patterns
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Monitoring works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Health scoring accuracy >90% with proper calibration
11. Trend analysis reliability >95% with minimal false trends
12. No regression in existing monitoring functionality
13. Health monitoring tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing monitoring infrastructure with health assessment capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Quality control reporting from Story 6.6
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within sensor and data processing limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Equipment health monitoring operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with health assessment procedures and scoring guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Inaccurate health scores leading to incorrect maintenance decisions
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper calibration, validation, and human oversight
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic monitoring with manual health assessment

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing monitoring systems
- [ ] Monitoring works with current sensor and data processing configurations
- [ ] Health assessment doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for maintenance planning
