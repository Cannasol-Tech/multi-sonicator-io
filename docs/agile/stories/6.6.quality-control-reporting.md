# Story 6.6: Quality Control Reporting Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.6
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Quality Assurance Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

Backlog

## User Story

As a quality assurance manager,
I want frequency stability and process control metrics reporting,
So that I can ensure consistent sonicator performance and meet quality standards.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing monitoring systems, data collection infrastructure, and analytics tools
- Technology: Quality control algorithms, statistical process control, reporting frameworks
- Follows pattern: Process control monitoring with quality metrics
- Touch points: Frequency measurements, stability indicators, quality control charts

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Frequency stability analysis and reporting for all sonicator units
2. Statistical process control (SPC) charts and quality metrics
3. Process capability analysis with Cp and Cpk calculations
4. Quality control alerting for out-of-control conditions
5. Compliance reporting for quality standards and regulations

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New quality control follows established SPC patterns and standards
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Reporting works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Quality control accuracy >99% with minimal measurement errors
11. Report generation time <3 minutes for standard quality reports
12. No regression in existing monitoring functionality
13. Quality control tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing monitoring infrastructure with quality control capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Real-time monitoring from Story 4.5
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within measurement and data processing limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Quality control reporting operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with quality procedures and control charts
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: False quality alerts causing unnecessary process interruptions
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper statistical control limits and validation procedures
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic monitoring with manual quality control

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing monitoring systems
- [ ] Reporting works with current measurement and data processing configurations
- [ ] Control doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for quality management
