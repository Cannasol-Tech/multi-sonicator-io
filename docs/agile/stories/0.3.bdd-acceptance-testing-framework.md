# Story 0.3: BDD Acceptance Testing Framework

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Quality Assurance Engineer,
**I want** a comprehensive BDD acceptance testing framework with HIL integration,
**so that** I can validate PRD requirements using behavior-driven scenarios that map directly to business requirements and execute on physical hardware.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. BDD testing framework operational with Gherkin scenario support
2. Acceptance scenarios mapped to PRD requirements with traceability
3. HIL integration enabling BDD tests to execute on physical hardware
4. Test scenario execution individually, by tag, and complete suite
5. Automated test reporting with requirement traceability
6. Test data management and scenario isolation
7. Continuous integration with automated BDD test execution
8. Test result visualization and reporting dashboard
9. Scenario versioning and change management
10. Performance validation within BDD scenarios (≤100ms MODBUS response)

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **BDD Framework**: Behave (Python) or Cucumber (JavaScript) for embedded systems
- **Scenario Format**: Gherkin syntax with Given-When-Then structure
- **Test Location**: test/acceptance/ with feature files and step definitions
- **Execution**: Individual, tagged, and complete suite execution modes
- **Reporting**: HTML reports with requirement traceability and metrics

### Architecture Context

- **Integration**: Direct integration with HIL test harness from Story 0.2
- **Hardware Control**: Step definitions for Arduino Test Wrapper commands
- **Communication**: MODBUS RTU testing with timing validation
- **Test Data**: Isolated test scenarios with hardware state management
- **Performance**: MODBUS response time validation ≤100ms

### Technical Constraints

- **Hardware Dependency**: Requires physical hardware for execution
- **Timing Sensitivity**: Real-time performance validation requirements
- **Test Isolation**: Each scenario must start from known hardware state
- **Resource Management**: Limited hardware resources for parallel execution
- **Safety Critical**: Must prevent hardware damage during test execution

### File Locations

- **Feature Files**: test/acceptance/features/ (Gherkin scenarios)
- **Step Definitions**: test/acceptance/steps/ (Python/JavaScript implementations)
- **Test Data**: test/acceptance/data/ (test datasets and configurations)
- **Reports**: test/reports/acceptance/ (HTML and JSON test reports)
- **Configuration**: test/acceptance/config/ (BDD framework configuration)

### BDD Scenario Structure

**Scenario Template Location:**
`test/acceptance/features/scenario-template.feature`

**Example Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: MODBUS Communication Validation
  As a PLC operator
  I want to control sonicators via MODBUS
  So that I can integrate with existing automation systems

  @modbus @communication @critical
  Scenario: Basic MODBUS Register Read
    Given the sonicator multiplexer is powered and connected
    And the MODBUS slave is configured for address 2
    When I read holding register 40001 (sonicator 1 status)
    Then the response should be received within 100ms
    And the register value should indicate current sonicator state
```

### Requirement Traceability

- **PRD Mapping**: Each scenario tagged with PRD requirement ID
- **Epic Traceability**: Scenarios linked to specific epic acceptance criteria
- **Coverage Analysis**: Automated reporting of requirement coverage
- **Gap Identification**: Automated detection of untested requirements

### Previous Story Insights

- Depends on Story 0.1 for CI/CD integration
- Depends on Story 0.2 for HIL test harness integration
- Foundation for all acceptance testing in subsequent epics
