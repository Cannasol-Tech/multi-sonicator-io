# Story 0.3: BDD Acceptance Testing Framework

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Quality Assurance Engineer,
**I want** a comprehensive BDD acceptance testing framework with HIL integration,

5. Automated test reporting with requirement traceability
6. Test data management and scenario isolation
7. Continuous integration with automated BDD test execution
8. Test result visualization and reporting dashboard
9. Scenario versioning and change management
10. Performance validation within BDD scenarios (≤100ms MODBUS response)

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **BDD Framework**: Behave (Python) or Cucumber (JavaScript) for embedded systems
- **Scenario Format**: Gherkin syntax with Given-When-Then structure
- **Test Location**: test/acceptance/ with feature files and step definitions
- **Execution**: Individual, tagged, and complete suite execution modes
- **Reporting**: HTML reports with requirement traceability and metrics

### Architecture Context

- **Integration**: Direct integration with HIL test harness from Story 0.2
- **Hardware Control**: Step definitions for Arduino Test Wrapper commands
- **Communication**: MODBUS RTU testing with timing validation
- **Test Data**: Isolated test scenarios with hardware state management
- **Performance**: MODBUS response time validation ≤100ms

### Technical Constraints

- **Hardware Dependency**: Requires physical hardware for execution
- **Timing Sensitivity**: Real-time performance validation requirements
- **Test Isolation**: Each scenario must start from known hardware state
- **Resource Management**: Limited hardware resources for parallel execution
- **Safety Critical**: Must prevent hardware damage during test execution

### File Locations

- **Feature Files**: test/acceptance/features/ (Gherkin scenarios)
- **Step Definitions**: test/acceptance/steps/ (Python/JavaScript implementations)
- **Test Data**: test/acceptance/data/ (test datasets and configurations)
- **Reports**: test/reports/acceptance/ (HTML and JSON test reports)
- **Configuration**: test/acceptance/config/ (BDD framework configuration)

### BDD Scenario Structure

**Scenario Template Location:**
`test/acceptance/features/scenario-template.feature`

**Example Scenario:**

```gherkin
Feature: MODBUS Communication Validation
  As a PLC operator
  I want to control sonicators via MODBUS
  So that I can integrate with existing automation systems

  @modbus @communication @critical
  Scenario: Basic MODBUS Register Read
    Given the sonicator multiplexer is powered and connected
    And the MODBUS slave is configured for address 2
    When I read holding register 40001 (sonicator 1 status)
    Then the response should be received within 100ms
    And the register value should indicate current sonicator state
```

### Requirement Traceability

- **PRD Mapping**: Each scenario tagged with PRD requirement ID
- **Epic Traceability**: Scenarios linked to specific epic acceptance criteria
- **Coverage Analysis**: Automated reporting of requirement coverage
- **Gap Identification**: Automated detection of untested requirements

### Previous Story Insights

- Depends on Story 0.1 for CI/CD integration
- Depends on Story 0.2 for HIL test harness integration
- Foundation for all acceptance testing in subsequent epics

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**STORY READINESS ASSESSMENT** - Story is in Draft status and not ready for implementation review.

**Current Status**: Draft - No implementation has been completed yet.

**Story Quality**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Comprehensive BDD framework story with detailed acceptance criteria and clear integration points.

**Architecture Assessment**: ✅ **WELL-DESIGNED**

- Clear integration with HIL test harness from Story 0.2
- Comprehensive BDD framework approach with Gherkin scenarios
- Proper requirement traceability mapping to PRD requirements
- Well-structured task breakdown covering all BDD aspects
- Excellent technical constraints and performance requirements

### Compliance Check

- **Story Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Complete story with all required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - 10 comprehensive ACs covering BDD framework
- **Task Breakdown**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 major tasks with detailed subtasks
- **Technical Documentation**: ✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive BDD architecture and examples

### Story Readiness Analysis

**Prerequisites for Implementation**:

1. ✅ Story structure complete and well-defined
2. ✅ Acceptance criteria comprehensive (10 ACs)
3. ✅ Task breakdown detailed and actionable (5 major tasks)
4. ✅ BDD framework architecture documented with examples
5. ❌ **DEPENDENCY**: Requires Story 0.2 (HIL Test Harness) to be completed first
6. ❌ **BLOCKING**: Story status is Draft, not ready for development

**Implementation Readiness Score**: 75/100 (excellent planning, dependency on Story 0.2)

### Dependency Analysis

**CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**:

- **Story 0.2 HIL Test Harness Setup**: Must be completed and unit test coverage issues resolved
- **Story 0.1 Project Structure**: Already completed (✅)
- **BDD Framework Selection**: Behave vs Cucumber decision needed

**INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**:

- HIL test harness integration for hardware execution
- PRD requirements mapping for traceability
- Performance validation (≤100ms MODBUS response)

### Recommendations for Development Team

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:

1. **WAIT for Story 0.2 Completion** - HIL test harness must be fully functional first
2. **Finalize BDD Framework Choice** - Behave (Python) vs Cucumber (JavaScript)
3. **Map PRD Requirements** - Create detailed FR1-FR12 mapping before implementation
4. **Change Story Status** from "Draft" to "In Progress" when dependencies met

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**:

- Task 1 (BDD Framework Setup) requires completed HIL integration
- Task 2 (HIL Integration) directly depends on Story 0.2 completion
- Performance requirements (≤100ms) must be validated on physical hardware
- Requirement traceability is critical for compliance

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM RISK** - Well-planned story but significant dependency on Story 0.2 completion.

**Potential Risks**:
- **High**: Story 0.2 unit test coverage issues could delay this story
- **Medium**: BDD framework integration complexity with embedded systems
- **Medium**: Performance validation on physical hardware timing
- **Low**: Requirement mapping complexity

### Gate Status

Gate: **DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED** → docs/qa/gates/0.3-bdd-acceptance-testing-framework.yml

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES** - Story planning is excellent but cannot proceed until Story 0.2 is completed.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Complete Story 0.2** - Resolve unit test coverage issues first
2. **Finalize BDD framework selection** (Behave recommended for Python ecosystem)
3. **Create detailed PRD requirement mapping** (FR1-FR12)
4. **Change status to In Progress** when dependencies are resolved
