# Story 0.1: Project Structure & CI/CD Pipeline

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Development Team Member,
**I want** a standardized project structure with automated CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** we can maintain consistent code quality, automated testing, and reliable deployment processes according to company standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Complete project structure following Axovia Flow company standards
2. CI/CD pipeline operational with automated testing and quality gates
3. Build system configured for ATmega32A target with PlatformIO
4. Automated code quality checks and linting integrated
5. Test automation framework integrated with CI/CD pipeline
6. Documentation generation automated (Doxygen)
7. Release management and versioning automated
8. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment integrated
9. Deployment pipeline with rollback capabilities
10. Compliance with company SOP for release adherence

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **Test Framework**: Unity testing framework via PlatformIO
- **Test Location**: test/ directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 85% statement coverage required
- **Test Patterns**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for unit tests
- **HIL Integration**: Test hooks for hardware-in-the-loop validation

### Architecture Context

- **Build System**: PlatformIO with Arduino framework for ATmega32A
- **Target Hardware**: ATmega32A microcontroller (32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM)
- **Communication**: MODBUS RTU slave implementation
- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml as sole source of truth
- **Project Structure**: Follows Axovia Flow company standards

### Technical Constraints

- **Memory Limitations**: 32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM constraints
- **Real-time Requirements**: Cooperative scheduling, no RTOS
- **Industrial Standards**: Must support IEC 61131 compliance path
- **Safety Requirements**: SIL 2 certification preparation
- **Performance**: MODBUS response times â‰¤100ms

### File Locations

- **Source Code**: src/ (main firmware code)
- **Headers**: include/ (public headers and interfaces)
- **Tests**: test/unit/ and test/integration/
- **Documentation**: docs/ (architecture, user guides, API docs)
- **Configuration**: config/ (hardware config, build settings)
- **CI/CD**: .github/workflows/ (GitHub Actions)

### Previous Story Insights

- This is the foundational story - no previous story context
- Critical for all subsequent development
- Must establish quality standards from the beginning
