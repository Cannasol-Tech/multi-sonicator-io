## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **Hardware Validation**: Automated testing with manual verification checkpoints
- **Test Coverage**: 100% pin assignment verification required
- **Documentation**: All tests must reference config/hardware-config.yaml
- **Safety**: Hardware protection during all testing procedures
- **Traceability**: Test results linked to specific pin assignments

### Architecture Context

- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml as single source of truth
- **Test Platform**: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi as test controller
- **DUT**: ATmega32A Sonicator Multiplexer hardware
- **Interfaces**: 4x DB9 sonicator + 1x DB9 MODBUS + ISP programming
- **Power**: 24V → 12V → 5V regulation cascade

### Technical Constraints

- **Hardware Access**: Physical access required for all testing
- **Safety Critical**: Must prevent hardware damage during verification
- **Timing Sensitive**: Signal integrity testing requires precise timing
- **Environmental**: Industrial operating conditions validation
- **Compliance**: Preparation for EMC and safety certification

### File Locations

- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml (pin matrix source)
- **Test Code**: test/hardware/ (hardware verification tests)
- **Test Reports**: test/reports/hardware/ (verification results)
- **Documentation**: docs/hardware/ (connection diagrams and reports)
- **Scripts**: test/scripts/hardware/ (automated verification scripts)

### Pin Matrix Validation

```yaml
# Example from config/hardware-config.yaml
arduino_test_wrapper:
  digital_pins:
    sonicator_1_start: 2
    sonicator_1_stop: 3
    sonicator_2_start: 4
    # ... additional pin assignments
atmega32a_dut:
  port_a:
    PA0: adc_sonicator_1_power
    PA1: adc_sonicator_2_power
    # ... additional pin assignments
```

### Hardware Verification Tests

- **Continuity Testing**: Automated ohmmeter functionality
- **Signal Integrity**: Oscilloscope-like signal analysis
- **Power Validation**: Voltage and current monitoring
- **Communication Testing**: Protocol-level validation
- **Safety Circuit Testing**: Emergency stop and fault detection

### Previous Story Insights

- Depends on Story 0.1 for project structure
- Depends on Story 0.2 for HIL test harness
- Critical foundation for all hardware-dependent stories
- Must establish hardware confidence before firmware development

### Code Quality Assessment

**STORY READINESS ASSESSMENT** - Story is in Draft status and not ready for implementation review.

**Current Status**: Draft - No implementation has been completed yet.

**Story Quality**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Comprehensive hardware verification story with detailed acceptance criteria and systematic approach.

**Architecture Assessment**: ✅ **WELL-STRUCTURED**

- Systematic approach to hardware validation with 5 major task areas
- Clear integration with config/hardware-config.yaml as single source of truth
- Comprehensive coverage of all hardware interfaces and connections
- Proper safety considerations and fault detection planning
- Well-defined technical constraints and validation requirements

### Compliance Check

- **Story Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Complete story with all required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - 10 comprehensive ACs covering all hardware aspects
- **Task Breakdown**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 major tasks with detailed subtasks
- **Technical Documentation**: ✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive hardware validation approach

### Story Readiness Analysis

**Prerequisites for Implementation**:

1. ✅ Story structure complete and well-defined
2. ✅ Acceptance criteria comprehensive (10 ACs)
3. ✅ Task breakdown detailed and actionable (5 major tasks)
4. ✅ Hardware validation approach documented
5. ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY**: Requires Story 0.2 (HIL Test Harness) to be functional
6. ❌ **BLOCKING**: Story status is Draft, not ready for development

**Implementation Readiness Score**: 80/100 (excellent planning, dependency on Story 0.2)

### Dependency Analysis

**CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**:

- **Story 0.2 HIL Test Harness Setup**: Must be completed with unit test coverage ≥90%
- **Story 0.1 Project Structure**: Already completed (✅)
- **Hardware Availability**: Physical hardware must be available for testing

**HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS**:

- Arduino Uno R4 WiFi test wrapper operational
- ATmega32A Sonicator Multiplexer DUT available
- All DB9 connectors and power systems functional
- config/hardware-config.yaml as authoritative pin matrix

### Recommendations for Development Team

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:

1. **WAIT for Story 0.2 Completion** - HIL test harness must be fully functional first
2. **Verify Hardware Availability** - Ensure all physical hardware is accessible
3. **Validate Pin Matrix** - Confirm config/hardware-config.yaml is current and accurate
4. **Change Story Status** from "Draft" to "In Progress" when dependencies met

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**:

- Task 1 (Pin Matrix Validation) requires config/hardware-config.yaml accuracy
- Task 2-4 require physical hardware access and HIL framework
- Task 5 requires safety circuit validation and emergency stop testing
- All tasks must reference hardware-config.yaml as single source of truth

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM RISK** - Well-planned story but dependent on Story 0.2 and hardware availability.

**Potential Risks**:
- **High**: Story 0.2 unit test coverage issues could delay this story
- **Medium**: Hardware availability and access for testing
- **Medium**: Pin matrix accuracy and configuration validation
- **Low**: Safety circuit testing complexity

### Gate Status

Gate: **DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED** → docs/qa/gates/0.4-hardware-connection-verification.yml

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES** - Story planning is excellent but cannot proceed until Story 0.2 is completed.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Complete Story 0.2** - Resolve HIL test harness unit test coverage issues
2. **Verify hardware availability** and access for testing
3. **Validate pin matrix accuracy** in config/hardware-config.yaml
4. **Change status to In Progress** when dependencies are resolved
