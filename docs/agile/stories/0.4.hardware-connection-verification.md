## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **Hardware Validation**: Automated testing with manual verification checkpoints
- **Test Coverage**: 100% pin assignment verification required
- **Documentation**: All tests must reference config/hardware-config.yaml
- **Safety**: Hardware protection during all testing procedures
- **Traceability**: Test results linked to specific pin assignments

### Architecture Context

- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml as single source of truth
- **Test Platform**: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi as test controller
- **DUT**: ATmega32A Sonicator Multiplexer hardware
- **Interfaces**: 4x DB9 sonicator + 1x DB9 MODBUS + ISP programming
- **Power**: 24V → 12V → 5V regulation cascade

### Technical Constraints

- **Hardware Access**: Physical access required for all testing
- **Safety Critical**: Must prevent hardware damage during verification
- **Timing Sensitive**: Signal integrity testing requires precise timing
- **Environmental**: Industrial operating conditions validation
- **Compliance**: Preparation for EMC and safety certification

### File Locations

- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml (pin matrix source)
- **Test Code**: test/hardware/ (hardware verification tests)
- **Test Reports**: test/reports/hardware/ (verification results)
- **Documentation**: docs/hardware/ (connection diagrams and reports)
- **Scripts**: test/scripts/hardware/ (automated verification scripts)

### Pin Matrix Validation

```yaml
# Example from config/hardware-config.yaml
arduino_test_wrapper:
  digital_pins:
    sonicator_1_start: 2
    sonicator_1_stop: 3
    sonicator_2_start: 4
    # ... additional pin assignments
atmega32a_dut:
  port_a:
    PA0: adc_sonicator_1_power
    PA1: adc_sonicator_2_power
    # ... additional pin assignments
```

### Hardware Verification Tests

- **Continuity Testing**: Automated ohmmeter functionality
- **Signal Integrity**: Oscilloscope-like signal analysis
- **Power Validation**: Voltage and current monitoring
- **Communication Testing**: Protocol-level validation
- **Safety Circuit Testing**: Emergency stop and fault detection

### Previous Story Insights

- Depends on Story 0.1 for project structure
- Depends on Story 0.2 for HIL test harness
- Critical foundation for all hardware-dependent stories
- Must establish hardware confidence before firmware development
