# Story 0.5: Arduino Test Wrapper Validation

**Story ID**: S-0.5
**Epic**: Epic 0: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Product Owner
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

NotStarted

## User Story

As a firmware QA engineer,
I want the Arduino Uno R4 test wrapper and ISP programming interface validated end-to-end,
so that we can reliably program and exercise the ATmega32A DUT during HIL testing.

## Scope

- Validate Arduino Uno R4 as ISP programmer for ATmega32A
- Verify serial command protocol between test wrapper and HIL tools
- Confirm pin mapping against `config/hardware-config.yaml` (SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- Smoke-test signal drive/measure paths used by acceptance tests

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Arduino Uno R4 ISP can program ATmega32A reliably (≥3 consecutive flashes) 
2. Serial protocol commands execute with expected responses within 100ms
3. All wrapper-to-DUT connections match `config/hardware-config.yaml`
4. Basic GPIO/ADC/PWM exercises pass via HIL scripts using the wrapper
5. Clear troubleshooting guide for common ISP/serial failures is documented

## Tasks

- [ ] Document ISP wiring and parameters for ATmega32A
- [ ] Add make target for ISP flash (if missing) and verify sequence
- [ ] Validate serial role toggles and bidirectional roles (wrapper/DUT) per pin matrix
- [ ] Run HIL smoke tests for GPIO/ADC/PWM through wrapper
- [ ] Capture logs/artifacts in `test/acceptance/logs/`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] ISP flashing passes 3x consecutively without error
- [ ] Serial command roundtrip verified across key commands
- [ ] Wrapper pin map validated vs `config/hardware-config.yaml`
- [ ] HIL smoke tests passing and logged
- [ ] Troubleshooting notes added to `docs/Testing/`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**STORY READINESS ASSESSMENT** - Story is in NotStarted status and not ready for implementation review.

**Current Status**: NotStarted - No implementation has been completed yet.

**Story Quality**: ✅ **GOOD** - Focused story with clear scope and practical acceptance criteria.

**Architecture Assessment**: ✅ **PRACTICAL APPROACH**

- Clear focus on Arduino Test Wrapper and ISP programming validation
- Practical acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes (≥3 consecutive flashes)
- Good integration with config/hardware-config.yaml as source of truth
- Reasonable scope for validation testing

### Compliance Check

- **Story Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Complete story with required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 clear and measurable ACs
- **Task Breakdown**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 focused tasks
- **Technical Documentation**: ✅ **PASS** - Clear scope and requirements

### Story Readiness Analysis

**Prerequisites for Implementation**:

1. ✅ Story structure complete and well-defined
2. ✅ Acceptance criteria clear and measurable (5 ACs)
3. ✅ Task breakdown focused and actionable (5 tasks)
4. ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY**: Requires Story 0.2 (HIL Test Harness) to be functional
5. ❌ **BLOCKING**: Story status is NotStarted, not ready for development

**Implementation Readiness Score**: 75/100 (good planning, dependency on Story 0.2)

### Dependency Analysis

**CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**:

- **Story 0.2 HIL Test Harness Setup**: Must be completed with unit test coverage ≥90%
- **Hardware Availability**: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and ATmega32A DUT must be available
- **Pin Matrix Accuracy**: config/hardware-config.yaml must be validated

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM RISK** - Focused story but dependent on Story 0.2 and hardware availability.

**Potential Risks**:
- **High**: Story 0.2 unit test coverage issues could delay this story
- **Medium**: ISP programming reliability and troubleshooting complexity
- **Low**: Serial protocol validation complexity

### Gate Status

Gate: **DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED** → docs/qa/gates/0.5-arduino-test-wrapper-validation.yml

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES** - Story planning is good but cannot proceed until Story 0.2 is completed.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Complete Story 0.2** - Resolve HIL test harness unit test coverage issues
2. **Verify hardware availability** for Arduino Test Wrapper and ATmega32A DUT
3. **Change status to In Progress** when dependencies are resolved
