# Story 6.8: Automated Report Generation Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.8
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Data Analytics Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a reporting coordinator,
I want scheduled reporting with customizable formats,
So that I can deliver reliable reports to stakeholders without manual intervention.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing reporting systems, data collection infrastructure, and analytics tools
- Technology: Report generation engines, scheduling systems, formatting tools
- Follows pattern: Automated report creation with customizable templates
- Touch points: Data sources, report templates, delivery mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Scheduled report generation with configurable intervals and timing
2. Customizable report formats including CSV, JSON, PDF, and HTML
3. Report templates with configurable content and styling options
4. Automated delivery mechanisms for email, file storage, and API endpoints
5. Report history and version management with retention policies

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing reporting systems extended without breaking changes
7. New report generation follows established formatting patterns and standards
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Reporting works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Report generation reliability >99.9% with minimal failures
11. Delivery success rate >99% for all configured destinations
12. No regression in existing reporting functionality
13. Report generation tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing reporting infrastructure with automation capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Operational documentation from Story 5.6
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within storage and network limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Automated report generation operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with scheduling procedures and template guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Report generation failures causing missed deliveries or incorrect information
- **Mitigation**: Implement error handling, retry mechanisms, and notification systems
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual report generation with basic templates

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing reporting systems
- [ ] Generation works with current data processing and storage configurations
- [ ] Automation doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for all stakeholders
