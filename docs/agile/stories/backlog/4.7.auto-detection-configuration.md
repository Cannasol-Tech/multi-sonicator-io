# Story 4.7: Auto-Detection & Configuration Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-4.7
**Epic**: Epic 4: Multi-Sonicator Coordination & Management
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Technical Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want automatic detection and configuration of connected sonicator units,
So that the system can dynamically adapt to different hardware configurations without manual setup.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing hardware configuration system, MODBUS communication layer, and HIL framework
- Technology: C/C++ embedded firmware, GPIO pin detection, configuration registers
- Follows pattern: Hardware abstraction with dynamic configuration
- Touch points: Sonicator connection detection pins, configuration registers, MODBUS address mapping

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Automatic detection of connected sonicator units at startup
2. Dynamic configuration of system parameters based on detected units
3. Active sonicator count tracking and bitmask status reporting
4. Manual override capability for configuration when auto-detection fails
5. Configuration persistence across power cycles

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing hardware configuration system extended without breaking changes
7. New auto-detection follows established configuration patterns
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Auto-detection works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Detection accuracy >99.5% for properly connected units
11. Configuration completion within 2 seconds of startup
12. No regression in existing manual configuration functionality
13. Configuration code follows project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing configuration system with auto-detection capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Hardware configuration from config/hardware-config.yaml
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within hardware limitations, maintain backward compatibility

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Auto-detection operational for all 4 sonicator units
- [ ] Documentation updated with configuration procedures and override instructions
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: False detection of connected units leading to incorrect configuration
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust detection algorithms with validation checks
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual configuration only

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing configuration system
- [ ] Auto-detection works with coordinated operation modes
- [ ] Manual override remains functional in all scenarios
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for MODBUS and Web UI consumption
