## User Story

As a quality assurance manager,
I want QMS procedures and compliance tracking integration,
So that I can ensure quality procedures are integrated and operational for compliance verification.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing quality management systems, compliance tracking, and process management
- Technology: Quality management tools, compliance tracking systems, process automation
- Follows pattern: Systematic quality management with compliance verification
- Touch points: Quality procedures, compliance metrics, process workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Quality management system integration with established procedures
2. Compliance tracking with systematic monitoring and reporting
3. Process automation with workflow management and execution
4. Quality metrics with performance monitoring and analysis
5. Audit trail with traceability and change management

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing quality systems extended without breaking changes
7. New integration follows established quality patterns and standards
8. Integration with current compliance tracking and process management
9. Management works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Quality management completeness >99% with proper procedure coverage
11. Compliance tracking accuracy >95% with minimal gaps
12. No regression in existing quality functionality
13. Management follows project standards and quality practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing quality infrastructure with compliance capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Quality control reporting from Story 6.6
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within quality management and compliance requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Quality management integration operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with management procedures and tracking guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Quality gaps causing compliance failures or process issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive tracking and systematic verification
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual quality management with basic tracking

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing quality systems
- [ ] Integration works with current quality and compliance configurations
- [ ] Management doesn't significantly impact development processes
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for quality monitoring
