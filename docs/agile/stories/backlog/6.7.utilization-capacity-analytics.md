# Story 6.7: Utilization & Capacity Analytics Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.7
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Operations Manager
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As an operations manager,
I want usage tracking and capacity planning analytics,
So that I can optimize resource allocation and plan for future expansion needs.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing monitoring systems, data collection infrastructure, and analytics tools
- Technology: Utilization tracking algorithms, capacity planning models, forecasting tools
- Follows pattern: Resource utilization monitoring with predictive analysis
- Touch points: Usage metrics, capacity indicators, planning forecasts

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Utilization tracking for all sonicator units and system resources
2. Capacity planning analytics with trend analysis and forecasting
3. Resource allocation optimization recommendations
4. Usage pattern identification and peak demand analysis
5. Expansion planning support with capacity gap analysis

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New utilization analytics follow established tracking patterns and methods
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Analytics work with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Utilization tracking accuracy >95% with minimal measurement errors
11. Forecasting accuracy >90% for short-term predictions (30 days)
12. No regression in existing monitoring functionality
13. Analytics tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing monitoring infrastructure with utilization analytics capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Performance monitoring from Story 5.7
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within data processing and storage limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Utilization and capacity analytics operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with planning procedures and optimization guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Inaccurate capacity forecasts leading to poor planning decisions
- **Mitigation**: Implement validation procedures and regular model updates
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual capacity planning with basic calculations

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing monitoring systems
- [ ] Analytics work with current data processing and storage configurations
- [ ] Analysis doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for planning and decision making
