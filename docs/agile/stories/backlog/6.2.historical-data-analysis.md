# Story 6.2: Historical Data Analysis Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.2
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Data Analytics Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a data analyst,
I want trend analysis and pattern identification capabilities,
So that I can identify performance patterns and optimize sonicator operations.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing data collection infrastructure, analytics tools, and reporting systems
- Technology: Data analysis algorithms, statistical processing, pattern recognition
- Follows pattern: Historical data processing with trend identification
- Touch points: Stored data, analysis results, reporting outputs

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Historical data analysis covering minimum 30-day rolling periods
2. Trend identification algorithms for performance metrics
3. Pattern recognition for operational anomalies and irregularities
4. Statistical analysis with confidence intervals and significance testing
5. Data visualization tools for trend exploration and analysis

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing analytics systems extended without breaking changes
7. New analysis follows established statistical patterns and methods
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Analysis works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Analysis accuracy >95% with minimal statistical errors
11. Processing time <5 minutes for standard analysis reports
12. No regression in existing analysis functionality
13. Analysis tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing analytics infrastructure with historical analysis capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Performance monitoring from Story 5.7
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within computational and storage limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Historical data analysis capabilities operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with analysis procedures and interpretation guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Incorrect analysis leading to poor operational decisions
- **Mitigation**: Implement data validation, quality checks, and peer review processes
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual analysis with basic statistical tools

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing analytics systems
- [ ] Analysis works with current data storage and processing configurations
- [ ] Analysis doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for decision making
