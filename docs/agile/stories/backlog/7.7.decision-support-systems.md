## User Story

As an operations manager,
I want AI-powered operational recommendations and decision support,
So that I can make informed decisions based on data-driven insights and confidence scores.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing analytics systems, reporting tools, and operational workflows
- Technology: Decision support algorithms, recommendation engines, confidence scoring
- Follows pattern: Actionable insights with uncertainty quantification
- Touch points: Analytics data, operational metrics, decision records

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. AI-powered operational recommendations with actionable insights
2. Confidence scoring for all recommendations with uncertainty quantification
3. Decision support with contextual information and impact analysis
4. Recommendation prioritization with business value assessment
5. Decision history and outcome tracking with learning feedback

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing analytics systems extended without breaking changes
7. New decision support follows established recommendation patterns and UI principles
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Support works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Recommendation accuracy >85% with proper validation
11. Confidence scoring reliability >90% with proper calibration
12. No regression in existing analytics functionality
13. Decision support tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing analytics infrastructure with decision support capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Performance analytics dashboard from Story 6.3
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within computational and user interface limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Decision support systems operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with recommendation procedures and usage guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Poor recommendations leading to suboptimal operational decisions
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper validation, human oversight, and feedback mechanisms
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual decision making with basic analytics

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing analytics systems
- [ ] Support works with current data processing and UI configurations
- [ ] Recommendations don't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for decision documentation
