## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want complete operational documentation including runbooks, procedures, and troubleshooting guides,
So that I can effectively operate and maintain the system with minimal reliance on development team support.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing documentation system, deployment procedures, and operational workflows
- Technology: Documentation tools, version control systems, publishing platforms
- Follows pattern: Comprehensive technical documentation with clear procedures
- Touch points: Deployment guides, operational procedures, troubleshooting steps

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Complete operational runbooks for daily system administration tasks
2. Detailed procedures for system setup, configuration, and maintenance
3. Comprehensive troubleshooting guides with diagnostic procedures
4. Emergency procedures and escalation protocols documentation
5. Regular documentation update and review processes

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing documentation system extended without breaking changes
7. New documentation follows established writing patterns and standards
8. Integration with current knowledge management systems
9. Documentation works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Documentation completeness >95% with minimal gaps
11. Procedure accuracy >99% with minimal errors
12. No regression in existing documentation quality
13. Documentation follows project standards and writing practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing documentation infrastructure with operational content
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Technical documentation from Story 1.0
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within documentation and version control limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Operational documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Documentation published and accessible to operational teams
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Documentation becoming outdated or inaccurate over time
- **Mitigation**: Implement regular review cycles and update procedures
- **Rollback**: Revert to previous documentation version with manual updates

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing documentation system
- [ ] Documentation works with current operational procedures
- [ ] Documentation doesn't interfere with normal operations
- [ ] Content generated in standard formats for easy consumption
