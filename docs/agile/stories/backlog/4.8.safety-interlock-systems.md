# Story 4.8: Safety Interlock Systems Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-4.8
**Epic**: Epic 4: Multi-Sonicator Coordination & Management
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: Safety Engineer
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a safety compliance officer,
I want comprehensive multi-unit safety interlock systems with emergency procedures,
So that all sonicator operations are conducted safely with proper fail-safe mechanisms.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing safety systems, emergency stop hardware, and HIL framework
- Technology: C/C++ embedded firmware, hardware safety interlocks, GPIO monitoring
- Follows pattern: Hardware-based safety with software coordination and monitoring
- Touch points: Emergency stop buttons, safety interlock sensors, MODBUS safety registers

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Multi-unit safety interlock coordination for all 4 sonicator units
2. Emergency shutdown procedures with <100ms response time across all units
3. Safety interlock status monitoring and reporting for each unit
4. Automatic safety system activation on critical fault conditions
5. Manual safety override with proper authorization and logging

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing safety systems extended without breaking changes
7. New safety interlocks follow established safety standards and protocols
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Safety systems work with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Safety system reliability >99.99% with no false negatives
11. Emergency shutdown completion within 100ms of activation
12. No regression in existing single-unit safety functionality
13. Safety code follows project safety standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing safety systems with multi-unit coordination
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Single-unit safety implementation from Story 1.4
- **Key Constraints**: Must meet industrial safety standards, maintain real-time response

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Safety interlock systems operational for all 4 sonicator units
- [ ] Documentation updated with safety procedures and emergency protocols
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Safety system failure leading to equipment or personnel hazard
- **Mitigation**: Implement redundant safety systems with hardware-based fail-safes
- **Rollback**: Revert to existing single-unit safety systems

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing safety systems
- [ ] Safety interlocks work with coordinated operation modes
- [ ] Emergency procedures remain functional in all scenarios
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for MODBUS and Web UI consumption
