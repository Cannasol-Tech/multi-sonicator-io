# Story 6.4: Operational Efficiency Reporting Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.4
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Data Analytics Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a process engineer,
I want efficiency metrics and optimization insights reporting,
So that I can identify opportunities to improve sonicator operations and reduce costs.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing analytics systems, reporting tools, and data collection infrastructure
- Technology: Efficiency algorithms, optimization models, reporting frameworks
- Follows pattern: Performance analysis with actionable insights
- Touch points: Efficiency metrics, optimization recommendations, cost analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Operational efficiency metrics calculation and reporting
2. Optimization insights with actionable recommendations
3. Cost analysis for energy consumption and resource utilization
4. Efficiency benchmarking against historical performance and targets
5. Customizable reporting periods and comparison intervals

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing reporting systems extended without breaking changes
7. New efficiency reporting follows established analysis patterns and methods
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Reporting works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Reporting accuracy >95% with minimal calculation errors
11. Report generation time <2 minutes for standard reports
12. No regression in existing reporting functionality
13. Reporting tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing reporting infrastructure with efficiency analysis capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Performance monitoring from Story 5.7
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within computational and data processing limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Operational efficiency reporting operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with reporting procedures and optimization guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Incorrect efficiency calculations leading to poor optimization decisions
- **Mitigation**: Implement data validation, peer review, and testing procedures
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual efficiency analysis with basic calculations

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing reporting systems
- [ ] Reporting works with current data processing and storage configurations
- [ ] Analysis doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for sharing and decision making
