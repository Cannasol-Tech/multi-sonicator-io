<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-8.5
**Epic**: Epic 8: Regulatory Compliance & Certification
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Security Engineer
**Created**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a security engineer,
I want security framework and vulnerability assessment for cybersecurity compliance,
So that I can achieve IEC 62443 compliance with security level 2 for protected deployment.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing security systems, vulnerability assessment, and certification management
- Technology: Security frameworks, vulnerability scanners, compliance tools
- Follows pattern: Systematic security evaluation with compliance verification
- Touch points: Network communication, access controls, security policies

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Cybersecurity compliance framework with IEC 62443 standards
2. Security level 2 achievement with proper control implementation
3. Vulnerability assessment with systematic scanning and analysis
4. Security testing with penetration testing and validation
5. Certification tracking with documentation and submission management

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing security systems extended without breaking changes
7. New compliance follows established security patterns and procedures
8. Integration with current vulnerability assessment and certification management
9. Compliance works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Security assessment completeness >99% with proper vulnerability coverage
11. Compliance achievement rate >90% with minimal re-assessment
12. No regression in existing security functionality
13. Compliance procedures follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing security infrastructure with compliance capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Security hardening from Story 5.5
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within security system and certification body limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Cybersecurity compliance operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with compliance procedures and certification guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Security gaps causing compliance failures or vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive assessment and systematic verification
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic security assessment with manual certification management

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing security systems
- [ ] Compliance works with current security and certification configurations
- [ ] Evaluation doesn't significantly impact development schedule
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for certification submission
