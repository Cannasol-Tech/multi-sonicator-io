# Story 4.5: Real-time Monitoring Systems Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-4.5
**Epic**: Epic 4: Multi-Sonicator Coordination & Management
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Technical Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a system operator,
I want real-time monitoring of all sonicator units with power, frequency, and status information,
So that I can monitor system health and quickly identify any issues during operation.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing MODBUS communication layer, single-sonicator monitoring, and HIL framework
- Technology: C/C++ embedded firmware, MODBUS RTU protocol, Arduino Test Wrapper
- Follows pattern: Real-time data collection and reporting through existing monitoring infrastructure
- Touch points: Power measurement ADCs, frequency measurement timers, status flag registers

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Real-time power consumption monitoring for all 4 sonicator units
2. Frequency measurement and lock detection for each unit
3. Status flag reporting for each unit (running, overload, frequency lock, etc.)
4. Active sonicator bitmask tracking and reporting
5. Monitoring data updated at 10Hz rate with <100ms MODBUS response times

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing MODBUS register map extended without breaking changes
7. New monitoring follows existing data collection and reporting patterns
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Monitoring data accessible through both MODBUS and Web UI interfaces

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Monitoring accuracy within ±2% for power measurements
11. Frequency measurement precision within ±0.1Hz for 20kHz signals
12. No regression in existing single-sonicator monitoring functionality
13. Monitoring code follows project coding standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing monitoring infrastructure with multi-unit data collection
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Single-sonicator monitoring implementation from Story 1.4
- **Key Constraints:** Must work within ATmega32A resource limitations, maintain real-time performance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Real-time monitoring operational for all 4 sonicator units
- [ ] Documentation updated with monitoring procedures and data formats
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Increased CPU load from multi-unit monitoring may impact real-time performance
- **Mitigation**: Optimize data collection algorithms, implement efficient scheduling
- **Rollback**: Revert to single-sonicator monitoring with reduced functionality

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing MODBUS register map
- [ ] Monitoring works with both individual and coordinated operation modes
- [ ] Data collection does not interfere with control operations
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for MODBUS and Web UI consumption
