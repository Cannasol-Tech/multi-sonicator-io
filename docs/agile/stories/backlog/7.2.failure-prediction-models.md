# Story 7.2: Failure Prediction Models Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-7.2
**Epic**: Epic 7: Predictive Maintenance & Optimization
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: AI/ML Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a reliability engineer,
I want equipment failure prediction with time-to-failure estimates,
So that I can schedule maintenance proactively and prevent unplanned downtime.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing predictive analytics infrastructure, data collection systems, and maintenance workflows
- Technology: Failure prediction algorithms, time-series analysis, statistical modeling
- Follows pattern: Predictive modeling with confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Touch points: Sensor data, maintenance records, failure history

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Equipment failure prediction models with ≥85% accuracy
2. Time-to-failure estimates with confidence intervals
3. Failure mode classification with root cause analysis
4. Early warning alerts with 7-day advance notification
5. Model explainability with feature importance and decision rationale

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing analytics systems extended without breaking changes
7. New models follow established ML patterns and validation methods
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Models work with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Prediction accuracy ≥85% with proper calibration
11. Model training time <24 hours for standard datasets
12. No regression in existing analytics functionality
13. Models follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing analytics infrastructure with failure prediction capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Historical data analysis from Story 6.2
- **Key Constraints**: Must work with available historical data and computational resources

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Failure prediction models operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with model development and validation procedures
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: False predictions causing unnecessary maintenance or missed failures
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper model validation, calibration, and human oversight
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic monitoring with manual failure detection

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing analytics systems
- [ ] Models work with current data processing and storage configurations
- [ ] Prediction doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for maintenance planning
