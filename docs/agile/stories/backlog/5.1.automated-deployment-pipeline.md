# Story 5.1: Automated Deployment Pipeline

**Story ID**: S-5.1  
**Epic**: Epic 5: Production Deployment & Operations  
**Priority**: Critical

## User Story
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

As a DevOps engineer,
I want an automated deployment pipeline that builds, tests, containers, and releases firmware, web UI, and test artifacts,
so that production deployments are reliable, repeatable, and observable with minimal downtime.

## Scope & Constraints

- Scope includes CI/CD for firmware (PlatformIO), Web UI (frontend + backend), and acceptance tests.
- Must integrate with existing `make` targets and repository structure.
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD (extend `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and/or add `release.yml`).
- Artifacts must be published for traceability (coverage, logs, export samples, binary outputs).
- Security: do not expose secrets in logs; use GitHub Secrets for tokens/keys.

---

## Objectives

- Unified pipeline with distinct stages: lint → build → unit tests → integration/acceptance → package → publish artifacts → release.
- Docker images for web-ui frontend (static) and backend (API) built and pushed (if configured).
- Firmware production build produced as artifact on tagged builds and main branch.
- Traceability matrix updated and attached as artifact on every run.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)

1. Pipeline Structure & Triggers
   - [ ] Given a commit to any branch @trace:S51-AC1
     When CI runs
     Then the pipeline executes stages for lint, build, tests, and artifacts without manual steps
     And on tags `v*` the release workflow additionally publishes versioned artifacts

2. Firmware Build & Artifact
   - [ ] Given the repository root @trace:S51-AC2
     When the pipeline runs the firmware build
     Then a production firmware binary is built using PlatformIO
     And the compiled hex/elf/map files are uploaded as CI artifacts

3. Web UI Build, Test, and Coverage
   - [ ] Given the `web-ui/` module @trace:S51-AC3
     When the pipeline builds and tests
     Then frontend and backend tests run with ≥85% coverage on new code
     And HTML coverage reports are uploaded as artifacts

4. Acceptance Tests & Traceability
   - [ ] Given acceptance BDD features @trace:S51-AC4
     When the pipeline executes the traceability scan
     Then `docs/traceability/bdd_traceability_matrix.csv` is regenerated and uploaded

5. Containerization
   - [ ] Given Dockerfiles in `web-ui/frontend/` and `web-ui/backend/` @trace:S51-AC5
     When the pipeline builds images
     Then images are tagged with commit SHA and optional semver tags
     And (if registry secrets are present) images are pushed to the configured registry

6. Release Publication (Tagged Builds)
   - [ ] Given a tag `vX.Y.Z` @trace:S51-AC6
     When the release workflow runs
     Then a GitHub Release is created with firmware binary, coverage summaries, and deployment instructions attached

---

## Technical Notes & Design

- Workflows
  - `ci.yml`: PR + push on main branches; runs lint, build, tests, artifacts, traceability.
  - `release.yml`: on tag `v*` builds release artifacts and creates GitHub Release.
- Make Targets
  - Reuse: `make build`, `make coverage`, `make web-ui-test`, `make web-ui-build`, `make web-ui-sandbox` (for smoke flows if feasible in CI).
- Artifacts
  - Firmware: `.pio/build/<env>/*.hex|*.elf|*.map`
  - Web UI: coverage HTML, junit reports if available
  - Traceability: `docs/traceability/bdd_traceability_matrix.csv`
  - Logs: build logs, test logs
- Secrets
  - `REGISTRY_URL`, `REGISTRY_USERNAME`, `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` for container push (optional)
  - `GH_TOKEN` (implicit) for release creation

---

## TDD Plan

- Write workflow tests using a minimal matrix or action validators (where applicable) and rely on repo test suites for code coverage gates.
- Add Behave feature for CI validation (metadata-only) to ensure the traceability scan includes S-5.1 ACs.
- Ensure `make` targets exit non-zero on failures to enforce CI correctness.

---

## Definition of Done

### Technical DoD
- [ ] CI pipeline runs automatically on PRs and main pushes
- [ ] Firmware production build artifacts available in CI
- [ ] Web UI builds and tests with ≥85% coverage; HTML reports uploaded
- [ ] Traceability matrix generated and uploaded
- [ ] Docker images built and optionally pushed (if secrets configured)
- [ ] Tagged releases publish artifacts and deployment notes

### Documentation DoD
- [ ] Update `web-ui/docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with CI/CD usage
- [ ] Update `README.md` with CI status badge and artifact access instructions
- [ ] Add `docs/CI_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md` section for automated deployment and releases

### Deployment DoD
- [ ] Containers built for backend and frontend
- [ ] Release artifacts generated and downloadable
- [ ] Optional: smoke test workflow for sandbox flow without hardware (sim-only)
