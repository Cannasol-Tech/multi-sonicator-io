## User Story

As a compliance officer,
I want regulatory submission preparation with complete documentation package,
So that I can prepare and submit all required documentation for certification approval.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing documentation systems, regulatory requirements, and submission management
- Technology: Document generation tools, template systems, submission tracking
- Follows pattern: Systematic documentation with compliance verification
- Touch points: Technical documentation, regulatory requirements, certification bodies

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Complete regulatory documentation package with all required submissions
2. Document generation with templates and automated content assembly
3. Submission tracking with status monitoring and deadline management
4. Documentation validation with compliance checking and error detection
5. Version control with audit trail and change management

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing documentation systems extended without breaking changes
7. New package follows established documentation patterns and standards
8. Integration with current regulatory requirements and submission management
9. Documentation works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Documentation completeness >99% with proper requirement coverage
11. Submission success rate >95% with minimal re-submission
12. No regression in existing documentation functionality
13. Documentation follows project standards and quality practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing documentation infrastructure with submission capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Operational documentation from Story 5.6
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within documentation standards and certification body requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Documentation and submission package operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with submission procedures and tracking guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Documentation gaps causing submission delays or certification rejection
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive validation and systematic review processes
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual documentation with basic submission management

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing documentation systems
- [ ] Package works with current documentation and submission configurations
- [ ] Generation doesn't significantly impact development schedule
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for certification submission
