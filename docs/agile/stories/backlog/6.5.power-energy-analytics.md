# Story 6.5: Power & Energy Analytics Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.5
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Data Analytics Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As an energy manager,
I want consumption analysis and efficiency tracking capabilities,
So that I can optimize power usage and reduce energy costs for sonicator operations.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing power monitoring systems, data collection infrastructure, and analytics tools
- Technology: Power analysis algorithms, energy efficiency models, consumption tracking
- Follows pattern: Energy monitoring with efficiency optimization
- Touch points: Power measurements, energy consumption, efficiency metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Power consumption analysis for all sonicator units
2. Energy efficiency tracking with trend identification
3. Consumption benchmarking against operational parameters
4. Energy cost calculation and optimization recommendations
5. Real-time power monitoring with alerting for anomalies

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing power monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New energy analytics follow established measurement patterns and standards
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Analytics work with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Power measurement accuracy >98% with minimal calibration errors
11. Analysis completion time <1 minute for standard energy reports
12. No regression in existing power monitoring functionality
13. Analytics tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing power monitoring infrastructure with energy analytics capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Real-time monitoring from Story 4.5
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within power measurement and data processing limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Power and energy analytics operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with energy analysis procedures and optimization guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Inaccurate power measurements leading to poor energy optimization decisions
- **Mitigation**: Implement calibration procedures and regular validation checks
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic power monitoring with manual analysis

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing power monitoring systems
- [ ] Analytics work with current power measurement and data processing configurations
- [ ] Analysis doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for energy management
