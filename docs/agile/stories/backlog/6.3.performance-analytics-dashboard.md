# Story 6.3: Performance Analytics Dashboard Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.3
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Data Analytics Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

Backlog

## User Story

As a operations manager,
I want KPI visualization and monitoring dashboard,
So that I can monitor system performance and make data-driven decisions in real-time.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing Web UI, data collection infrastructure, and analytics systems
- Technology: Dashboard frameworks, visualization libraries, real-time data processing
- Follows pattern: Interactive data visualization with real-time updates
- Touch points: KPI metrics, performance indicators, alert systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Real-time performance analytics dashboard with KPI visualization
2. Interactive data exploration tools with filtering and drill-down capabilities
3. Customizable dashboard layouts with user preferences persistence
4. Real-time updates within 5 seconds of data changes
5. Multi-unit performance comparison and benchmarking features

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing Web UI extended without breaking changes
7. New dashboard follows established UI patterns and design principles
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Dashboard works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Dashboard performance with updates within 5 seconds
11. Visualization accuracy >99% with minimal display errors
12. No regression in existing Web UI functionality
13. Dashboard follows project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing Web UI with analytics dashboard capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Web UI from Story 3.1
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within browser and network limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Performance analytics dashboard operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with dashboard usage and customization guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Dashboard complexity overwhelming users or impacting performance
- **Mitigation**: Implement progressive disclosure design with role-based views
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic dashboard with essential metrics only

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing Web UI
- [ ] Dashboard works with current browser and network configurations
- [ ] Visualization doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for sharing and presentation
