# Story 7.1: Predictive Analytics Infrastructure Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-7.1
**Epic**: Epic 7: Predictive Maintenance & Optimization
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: AI/ML Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As an AI/ML engineer,
I want ML/AI platform and model deployment infrastructure,
So that I can develop and deploy predictive maintenance models for equipment optimization.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing data collection infrastructure, analytics systems, and deployment pipelines
- Technology: Machine learning platforms, model deployment frameworks, cloud computing resources
- Follows pattern: Scalable AI infrastructure with model management capabilities
- Touch points: Data sources, model repositories, deployment endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Machine learning platform with model development and training capabilities
2. Model deployment infrastructure with scalable serving and inference
3. Model versioning and management system with rollback capabilities
4. Data pipeline integration for real-time model inputs
5. Monitoring and observability for model performance and health

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing analytics systems extended without breaking changes
7. New infrastructure follows established deployment patterns and standards
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Infrastructure works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Model deployment reliability >99.5% with minimal downtime
11. Inference response time <1 second for standard predictions
12. No regression in existing analytics functionality
13. Infrastructure follows project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing analytics infrastructure with ML/AI capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Data collection infrastructure from Story 6.1
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within computational and storage limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Predictive analytics infrastructure operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with infrastructure setup and model deployment guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Infrastructure complexity causing maintenance overhead and reliability issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic analytics with manual model deployment

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing analytics systems
- [ ] Infrastructure works with current data processing and storage configurations
- [ ] Deployment doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for monitoring and management
