# Story 8.2: EMC Testing & Certification Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-8.2
**Epic**: Epic 8: Regulatory Compliance & Certification
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: Compliance Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a compliance officer,
I want electromagnetic compatibility validation and certification,
So that I can ensure successful EMC testing completion for legal deployment in regulated markets.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing hardware design, testing infrastructure, and certification management
- Technology: EMC testing equipment, validation procedures, certification tracking
- Follows pattern: Systematic testing with compliance verification
- Touch points: Hardware design, test equipment, certification bodies

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Electromagnetic compatibility testing with IEC 61000 series compliance
2. EMC validation procedures with systematic testing and verification
3. Test equipment integration with hardware under test
4. Certification tracking with documentation and submission management
5. Pre-compliance testing with design validation before formal testing

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing hardware design extended without breaking changes
7. New testing follows established validation patterns and procedures
8. Integration with current testing infrastructure and certification management
9. Testing works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. EMC testing success rate >95% with minimal re-testing
11. Certification completion time <90 days from test initiation
12. No regression in existing hardware functionality
13. Testing procedures follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing testing infrastructure with EMC capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Hardware verification from Story 1.1
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within testing equipment and certification body limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] EMC testing and certification operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing procedures and certification guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Testing failures requiring expensive re-testing and delays
- **Mitigation**: Implement pre-compliance testing and design validation
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic testing with manual certification management

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing hardware design
- [ ] Testing works with current equipment and certification configurations
- [ ] Validation doesn't significantly impact development schedule
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for certification submission
