# Story 5.2: Production Environment Setup Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-5.2
**Epic**: Epic 5: Production Deployment & Operations
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: DevOps Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer,
I want consistent hardware provisioning and configuration management procedures,
So that production environments are reliably configured and validated for deployment.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing hardware configuration system, deployment pipeline, and HIL framework
- Technology: Hardware provisioning scripts, configuration management tools, validation procedures
- Follows pattern: Automated hardware setup with validation checks
- Touch points: Hardware configuration files, deployment scripts, validation tools

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Automated hardware provisioning procedures for production environments
2. Configuration management system for consistent environment setup
3. Hardware validation procedures to verify correct setup
4. Environment documentation with setup and configuration details
5. Rollback procedures for failed environment configurations

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing deployment pipeline extended without breaking changes
7. New environment setup follows established configuration patterns
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Environment setup works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Environment setup reliability >99.5% with minimal manual intervention
11. Configuration validation completes within 5 minutes
12. No regression in existing environment setup functionality
13. Setup procedures follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing deployment infrastructure with environment setup capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Hardware configuration from config/hardware-config.yaml
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within hardware limitations, maintain security practices

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Production environment setup operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup procedures and validation steps
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Incorrect hardware configuration causing system failures
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive validation checks and rollback procedures
- **Rollback**: Revert to previous known good configuration

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing deployment pipeline
- [ ] Environment setup works with current hardware configurations
- [ ] Validation procedures don't interfere with normal operations
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for monitoring and auditing
