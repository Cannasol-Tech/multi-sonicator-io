# Story 5.4: Backup & Recovery Procedures Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-5.4
**Epic**: Epic 5: Production Deployment & Operations
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: DevOps Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want automated backup and disaster recovery procedures for firmware and configuration data,
So that I can quickly restore system functionality after data loss or hardware failures.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing firmware deployment system, configuration management, and HIL framework
- Technology: Backup automation tools, recovery scripts, data replication mechanisms
- Follows pattern: Automated data protection with regular validation
- Touch points: Firmware images, configuration files, system state data

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Automated backup procedures for firmware and configuration data
2. Disaster recovery procedures with <4 hour recovery time objective (RTO)
3. Backup validation and integrity checking mechanisms
4. Backup retention policies with historical version management
5. Recovery testing procedures with regular validation schedules

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing deployment system extended without breaking changes
7. New backup procedures follow established data protection patterns
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Backup works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Backup success rate >99.9% with minimal failures
11. Recovery validation completes within 1 hour
12. No regression in existing backup functionality
13. Backup procedures follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing deployment infrastructure with backup capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Firmware deployment from Story 5.1
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within storage and network limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with backup procedures and recovery steps
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Backup failure leading to unrecoverable data loss
- **Mitigation**: Implement redundant backup systems and regular validation
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual backup procedures

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing deployment system
- [ ] Backup works with current hardware and software configurations
- [ ] Recovery procedures don't interfere with normal operations
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for auditing and compliance
