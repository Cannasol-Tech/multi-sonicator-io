# Story 2.1: Unit Test Coverage Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-2.1
**Epic**: Epic 2: Testing Infrastructure
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: QA Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a QA engineer,
I want comprehensive unit test coverage with metrics reporting,
So that I can ensure code quality meets the 85% coverage requirement and identify untested code areas.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing Unity test framework from Story 2.0
- Technology: Unity Native Environment, C/C++ embedded testing
- Follows pattern: Modular test structure with individual module isolation
- Touch points: All source modules (hal, communication, control, sonicator)

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Unit tests implemented for all source code modules (hal, communication, control, sonicator)
2. Coverage metrics generated automatically during test execution
3. Coverage reports meet or exceed 85% statement coverage requirement
4. Tests execute successfully via `make test-unit` target
5. Coverage reports are consumable by CI/CD pipeline and reporting dashboard

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing functionality continues to work unchanged
7. New tests follow existing Unity testing patterns and conventions
8. Integration with CI/CD pipeline maintains current workflow
9. Test execution does not impact firmware build performance

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Tests cover edge cases and error conditions
11. Coverage reports are accurate and provide actionable insights
12. No regression in existing functionality verified
13. Test code follows project coding standards

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing Unity test framework with coverage instrumentation
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Unity test structure and organization from Story 2.0
- **Key Constraints:** Must work within embedded environment limitations, maintain real-time performance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Coverage reports integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated with coverage procedures
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Coverage tools may have compatibility issues with embedded environment
- **Mitigation:** Use proven Unity coverage tools, test incrementally, validate in isolated environment
- **Rollback:** Revert to existing test structure without coverage metrics

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing test framework
- [ ] Coverage instrumentation doesn't affect runtime performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for CI/CD consumption
- [ ] Memory usage remains within embedded constraints
