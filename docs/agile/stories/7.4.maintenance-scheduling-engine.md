# Story 7.4: Maintenance Scheduling Engine Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-7.4
**Epic**: Epic 7: Predictive Maintenance & Optimization
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Maintenance Manager
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a maintenance manager,
I want predictive maintenance planning and optimization capabilities,
So that I can reduce downtime by 30% through optimal scheduling and resource allocation.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing maintenance management systems, failure prediction models, and resource planning tools
- Technology: Scheduling algorithms, optimization models, resource allocation systems
- Follows pattern: Predictive scheduling with constraint optimization
- Touch points: Maintenance records, resource availability, failure predictions

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Predictive maintenance scheduling with optimal downtime reduction
2. Resource allocation optimization for maintenance activities
3. Maintenance window planning with production schedule coordination
4. Cost optimization for maintenance activities and spare parts
5. Schedule recommendations with confidence levels and risk assessments

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing maintenance systems extended without breaking changes
7. New scheduling follows established planning patterns and workflows
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Scheduling works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Schedule optimization achieving 30% downtime reduction
11. Planning accuracy >90% with minimal schedule conflicts
12. No regression in existing maintenance functionality
13. Scheduling tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing maintenance infrastructure with predictive scheduling capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Utilization and capacity analytics from Story 6.7
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within maintenance resource and scheduling limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Maintenance scheduling engine operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with scheduling procedures and optimization guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Suboptimal schedules causing production disruptions or maintenance delays
- **Mitigation**: Implement constraint validation and human review processes
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual scheduling with basic optimization

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing maintenance systems
- [ ] Scheduling works with current resource and workflow configurations
- [ ] Planning doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for maintenance management
