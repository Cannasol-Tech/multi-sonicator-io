## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** hardware validation engineer,
**I want** complete automated verification of all 39 ATmega32A pins against the approved pin matrix,
**so that** I can ensure 100% hardware connectivity accuracy and establish trust in the physical hardware foundation.

- Provides testing infrastructure for reliable firmware development and validation against physical hardware

## Story Context

**Pin Matrix Validation:**

- Complete verification of all 39 ATmega32A DIP-40 pins (Pin 1 and Pin 40 are power/ground)
- Validation against `config/hardware-config.yaml` as SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- Automated pin verification via Arduino Test Wrapper interface
- Real-time hardware signal monitoring and logging

**Integration Points:**

- ATmega32A hardware via Arduino Test Wrapper
- Pin matrix documentation as single source of truth
- HIL test controller for automated validation
- Hardware signal monitoring and logging systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Pin Matrix Compliance Requirements:**

1. All 39 functional pins validated against `config/hardware-config.yaml` with 100% accuracy
2. Pin verification process detects and reports any pin assignment mismatches or connectivity issues
3. Hardware connectivity validation covers all sonicator control signals (START_X, RST_X)
4. Power monitoring pins (PWR_MONITOR_1-4) verified for correct ADC channel mapping

**Signal Verification Requirements:**

5. Frequency monitoring pins (FREQ_LOCK_1-4) validated for correct input signal connectivity
6. Overload detection pins (OVERLOAD_1-4) verified for proper optocoupler interface
7. Amplitude control PWM output (PB3) validated for correct signal generation
8. MODBUS UART pins (PD0/PD1) verified for communication interface connectivity

**Hardware Interface Validation:**

9. Arduino Test Wrapper interface successfully controls and monitors all target pins
10. Pin verification process completes in <5 minutes with detailed reporting
11. Hardware signal integrity verified (voltage levels, timing, noise immunity)
12. All pin verification results logged with timestamps and signal characteristics

## Technical Implementation Details

### Pin Matrix Verification Process

```python
# test/integration/test_pin_matrix_verification.py
def test_pin_matrix_compliance():
    """Verify all pins against approved pin matrix"""
    pin_matrix = load_pin_matrix("config/hardware-config.yaml")
    arduino_wrapper = ArduinoTestWrapper()
    
    for pin_definition in pin_matrix.pins:
        verify_pin_connectivity(pin_definition)
        validate_signal_integrity(pin_definition)
        log_pin_verification_result(pin_definition)
```
