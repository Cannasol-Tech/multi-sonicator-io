## User Story

**As a** hardware test engineer and firmware developer
**I want** a modern web-based interface for the Arduino test harness
**So that** I can interactively test ATmega32A firmware functionality without command-line expertise and visualize real-time hardware behavior

## Core Requirements

1. **Full Sandbox Mode Operation**: The web user interface must work in full sandbox mode and supply a continual configuration and monitoring loop between the User Interface and the Arduino Test harness that wraps the DUT as described SOLELY in the `pin-matrix.md`.

2. **Single Page Application**: The Web user interface must be a single page with a diagram clearly outlining the connections between the Arduino test harness and the ATmega32A (DUT).

3. **Complete Pin State Monitoring**: The Web user interface must clearly display the current state of ALL monitored pins on the DUT with real-time updates.

4. **User Experience**: The Web user interface must contain comprehensive help text for ease of use and clarity to improve efficiency for new users when using the tool.

5. **Functionality-First Approach**: The tool must be implemented purely for functionality. We need to get this fully functioning quickly with minimal aesthetic considerations.

6. **Test Coverage**: The tool must be tested with 90% unit test coverage using a front-end test framework (pytest preferred for consistency with existing test infrastructure).

7. **Sandbox Mode Launch**: The web-ui must be able to be launched in sandbox mode by executing the make target `make web-ui-sandbox`. This target must always build and upload the latest firmware (multi-sonicator-io source code production build) to the ATmega32A (DUT) using the Arduino as ISP before launching the web interface.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Serial Port Management**: Single serial connection shared between CLI and web interface
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Real-time Requirements**: Hardware monitoring needs sub-second response times

### Integration Risks

- üî¥ **Resource Contention**: Serial port conflicts between existing CLI tools and web UI
- üü° **Dependency Complexity**: Node.js + Python interprocess communication
- üü° **State Synchronization**: Multiple clients accessing same hardware state

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Decision

**Integrated Brownfield Approach**: Extend existing project with `web-ui/` module rather than standalone application

```
multi-sonicator-io/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-ui/                    # New React UI module
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/             # React + TypeScript + Vite
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/              # Node.js + Express + WebSocket
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/               # Common types and utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                  # Existing Python HIL modules (reuse)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/acceptance/hil_framework/  # Existing HIL infrastructure (reuse)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile                  # Extended with web UI targets
```

### Integration Points

1. **Python-Node.js Bridge**: Node.js backend spawns Python processes for HIL operations
2. **Shared Configuration**: Both systems use existing `hil_config.yaml`
3. **Serial Port Coordination**: Implement mutex/locking for shared hardware access
4. **WebSocket Real-time**: Live hardware state updates to React frontend
5. **Visual Asset Integration**: Use existing resource images and pin matrix documentation
   - `resource/arduino-uno-r3-icon.png` for Arduino Test Wrapper representation
   - `resource/atmega-32-a-icon.png` for ATmega32A DUT representation
   - `docs/planning/pin-matrix.md` as SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for pin connections and signal mapping
