# Story 0.7: MODBUS Hardware Validation

**Story ID**: S-0.7
**Epic**: Epic 0: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Product Owner
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

NotStarted

## User Story

As a firmware/QA engineer,
I want to validate the MODBUS communication layer on physical hardware,
so that hardware-in-the-loop tests can reliably exercise all registers and control paths.

## Scope

- Validate RTU parameters (115200 baud, 8N1) and timing on physical bus
- Verify read/write operations for defined MODBUS registers
- Confirm error handling (CRC errors, timeouts, invalid function codes)
- Exercise end-to-end control path via MODBUS to DUT through Arduino wrapper

## Acceptance Criteria

1. MODBUS RTU slave responds to reads/writes within 100ms
2. Register map validated against `include/register_map.h` and documentation
3. Error conditions (CRC, timeout) handled and logged in HIL tests
4. End-to-end control and telemetry verified via MODBUS using HIL framework
5. Test scripts can be executed via `make test-acceptance` with hardware attached

## Tasks

- [ ] Confirm UART settings and wiring; document in `docs/Testing/`
- [ ] Create/verify HIL test cases for register read/write and boundary conditions
- [ ] Add negative tests for CRC error and timeout behavior
- [ ] Validate modulation paths (GPIO/ADC/PWM) triggered via MODBUS registers
- [ ] Capture logs and artifacts in `test/acceptance/logs/`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met on physical hardware
- [ ] HIL tests for MODBUS pass consistently (≥3 consecutive runs)
- [ ] Documentation of register validation and troubleshooting updated

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**STORY READINESS ASSESSMENT** - Story is in NotStarted status and not ready for implementation review.

**Current Status**: NotStarted - No implementation has been completed yet.

**Story Quality**: ✅ **GOOD** - Focused MODBUS validation story with clear technical requirements.

**Architecture Assessment**: ✅ **PRACTICAL APPROACH**

- Clear focus on MODBUS RTU communication validation
- Specific technical requirements (115200 baud, 8N1, 100ms response)
- Good integration with HIL framework for end-to-end testing
- Practical acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes

### Compliance Check

- **Story Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Complete story with required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 clear and technical ACs
- **Task Breakdown**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 focused tasks
- **Technical Documentation**: ✅ **PASS** - Clear MODBUS requirements

### Story Readiness Analysis

**Prerequisites for Implementation**:

1. ✅ Story structure complete and well-defined
2. ✅ Acceptance criteria clear and measurable (5 ACs)
3. ✅ Task breakdown focused and actionable (5 tasks)
4. ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY**: Requires Story 0.2 (HIL Test Harness) to be functional
5. ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY**: Requires register map definition in include/register_map.h
6. ❌ **BLOCKING**: Story status is NotStarted, not ready for development

**Implementation Readiness Score**: 70/100 (good planning, multiple dependencies)

### Dependency Analysis

**CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES**:

- **Story 0.2 HIL Test Harness Setup**: Must be completed with unit test coverage ≥85%
- **Register Map Definition**: include/register_map.h must be defined and documented
- **MODBUS Implementation**: Basic MODBUS RTU slave implementation needed
- **Hardware Availability**: Physical MODBUS communication interface required

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM-HIGH RISK** - MODBUS protocol complexity and multiple dependencies.

**Potential Risks**:
- **High**: Story 0.2 unit test coverage issues could delay this story
- **Medium**: MODBUS protocol implementation complexity
- **Medium**: Register map definition and validation complexity
- **Low**: Hardware communication interface reliability

### Gate Status

Gate: **DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED** → docs/qa/gates/0.7-modbus-hardware-validation.yml

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES** - Story planning is good but multiple dependencies must be resolved first.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Complete Story 0.2** - Resolve HIL test harness unit test coverage issues
2. **Define register map** in include/register_map.h
3. **Implement basic MODBUS RTU slave** functionality
4. **Change status to In Progress** when dependencies are resolved
