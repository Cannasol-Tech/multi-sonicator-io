# Story 1.3: BDD Acceptance Testing Framework

**Story ID**: S-0.3
**Feature**: F-002: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Product Owner (Sarah)
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** quality assurance engineer,
**I want** a comprehensive BDD acceptance testing framework that maps test scenarios to PRD requirements,
**so that** I can validate firmware functionality against business requirements using executable specifications on real hardware.

## Feature Context

**Feature F-002: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification**

- Goal: Establish comprehensive Hardware-in-the-Loop testing framework and validate all hardware connections
- Provides systematic validation of PRD requirements through executable BDD scenarios

## Story Context

**BDD Acceptance Testing Framework:**

- pytest + Behave framework for behavior-driven testing
- BDD scenarios mapped directly to PRD requirements (FR1-FR12)
- Integration with HIL hardware for real-world validation
- Executable specifications that serve as both tests and documentation

**Integration Points:**

- HIL test harness for hardware control and monitoring
- pytest + Behave for BDD scenario execution
- PRD requirement traceability and validation
- Test reporting and requirement coverage analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

**BDD Framework Requirements:**

1. pytest + Behave framework configured for BDD acceptance testing scenarios
2. BDD scenarios mapped to all PRD functional requirements (FR1-FR12) with traceability
3. Gherkin feature files provide executable specifications for sonicator control functionality
4. BDD scenarios execute on physical hardware via HIL test harness integration

**Requirement Coverage and Validation:**

5. Sonicator control scenarios validate start/stop/reset operations per FR1-FR4
6. MODBUS communication scenarios validate register operations per FR5-FR8
7. Power monitoring scenarios validate measurement and reporting per FR9-FR10
8. Safety and error handling scenarios validate fault conditions per FR11-FR12

**Test Execution and Reporting:**

9. `make test-acceptance` executes complete BDD suite with hardware validation
10. BDD test results provide clear pass/fail status with requirement traceability
11. Acceptance test execution completes within <15 minutes for complete suite
12. Test reports include PRD requirement coverage analysis and gaps identification

## Technical Implementation Details

### BDD Framework Structure

```gherkin
# test/acceptance/features/sonicator_control.feature
Feature: Sonicator Control Operations
  As a PLC operator
  I want to control sonicator operations via MODBUS
  So that I can manage ultrasonic cleaning processes

  @requirement_FR1
  Scenario: Start sonicator operation
    Given the Multi-Sonicator system is initialized
    And sonicator 1 is in stopped state
    When I send MODBUS command to start sonicator 1
    Then sonicator 1 status indicates running
    And START_1 signal is asserted on PC6
    And sonicator power monitoring shows active power draw
```

### Requirement Mapping Structure

```python
# test/acceptance/features/steps/requirement_mapping.py
REQUIREMENT_MAPPING = {
    "FR1": ["sonicator_start", "modbus_start_command"],
    "FR2": ["sonicator_stop", "modbus_stop_command"],
    "FR3": ["sonicator_reset", "emergency_stop"],
    # ... mapping for FR1-FR12
}
```

### BDD Integration with HIL

```python
# test/acceptance/features/steps/sonicator_steps.py
from test.integration.hil_test_harness import HILTestHarness

@given("the Multi-Sonicator system is initialized")
def step_system_initialized(context):
    context.hil_harness = HILTestHarness()
    context.hil_harness.initialize_hardware()

@when("I send MODBUS command to start sonicator 1")
def step_modbus_start_sonicator(context):
    result = context.hil_harness.modbus_write_register(0x0010, 1)
    assert result.success
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**STORY DUPLICATION IDENTIFIED** - This story appears to duplicate Story 0.3 BDD Acceptance Testing Framework.

**Current Status**: Draft - No implementation has been completed yet.

**Story Quality**: ⚠️ **DUPLICATION CONCERN** - Well-structured story but overlaps significantly with 0.3.bdd-acceptance-testing-framework.md

**Architecture Assessment**: ✅ **WELL-DESIGNED** but **REDUNDANT**

- Similar BDD framework approach as the other 0.3 story
- Good integration with HIL test harness planning
- Comprehensive PRD requirement mapping (FR1-FR12)
- Detailed task breakdown and technical implementation

### Compliance Check

- **Story Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Complete story with all required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - 12 comprehensive ACs covering BDD framework
- **Task Breakdown**: ✅ **PASS** - 6 major tasks with detailed subtasks
- **Story Uniqueness**: ❌ **FAIL** - Significant overlap with other 0.3 story

### Story Duplication Analysis

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Two Story 0.3 files exist with similar BDD acceptance testing scope:

1. **0.3.bdd-acceptance-testing-framework.md** - General BDD framework setup
2. **0.3.bdd-acceptance-testing.md** - PRD-specific BDD scenarios (this file)

**OVERLAP AREAS**:
- Both address BDD framework setup and configuration
- Both include HIL integration requirements
- Both cover test execution and reporting
- Both reference pytest + Behave framework

**DIFFERENTIATION**:
- This story focuses more on PRD requirement mapping (FR1-FR12)
- This story has more detailed Gherkin examples
- This story includes specific sonicator control scenarios

### Recommendations for Development Team

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:

1. **RESOLVE STORY DUPLICATION** - Merge or clearly differentiate the two 0.3 stories
2. **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**:
   - **Keep this story** (0.3.bdd-acceptance-testing.md) as it's more PRD-specific
   - **Archive or merge** the other 0.3 story to avoid confusion
   - **Rename this story** to "0.3 BDD Acceptance Testing with PRD Mapping"

3. **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT** - Same dependencies as other 0.3 story:
   - Story 0.2 HIL Test Harness must be completed first
   - BDD framework selection needed

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK** - Story duplication creates confusion and potential rework.

**Potential Risks**:
- **High**: Development team confusion about which story to implement
- **High**: Duplicate effort if both stories are worked simultaneously
- **Medium**: Integration complexity with Story 0.2 dependencies

### Gate Status

Gate: **DUPLICATION_ISSUE** → docs/qa/gates/0.3-bdd-acceptance-testing.yml

### Recommended Status

**❌ BLOCKED BY DUPLICATION** - Story duplication must be resolved before development can proceed.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Resolve duplication** with product owner - recommend keeping this story
2. **Archive or merge** the other 0.3 story
3. **Wait for Story 0.2 completion** before proceeding
4. **Rename for clarity** to avoid future confusion
