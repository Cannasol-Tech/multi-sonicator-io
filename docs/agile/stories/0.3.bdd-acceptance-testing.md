# Story 1.3: BDD Acceptance Testing Framework

**Story ID**: S-0.3
**Feature**: F-002: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Product Owner (Sarah)
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** quality assurance engineer,
**I want** a comprehensive BDD acceptance testing framework that maps test scenarios to PRD requirements,
**so that** I can validate firmware functionality against business requirements using executable specifications on real hardware.

## Feature Context

**Feature F-002: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification**

- Goal: Establish comprehensive Hardware-in-the-Loop testing framework and validate all hardware connections
- Provides systematic validation of PRD requirements through executable BDD scenarios

## Story Context

**BDD Acceptance Testing Framework:**

- pytest + Behave framework for behavior-driven testing
- BDD scenarios mapped directly to PRD requirements (FR1-FR12)
- Integration with HIL hardware for real-world validation
- Executable specifications that serve as both tests and documentation

**Integration Points:**

- HIL test harness for hardware control and monitoring
- pytest + Behave for BDD scenario execution
- PRD requirement traceability and validation
- Test reporting and requirement coverage analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

**BDD Framework Requirements:**

1. pytest + Behave framework configured for BDD acceptance testing scenarios
2. BDD scenarios mapped to all PRD functional requirements (FR1-FR12) with traceability
3. Gherkin feature files provide executable specifications for sonicator control functionality
4. BDD scenarios execute on physical hardware via HIL test harness integration

**Requirement Coverage and Validation:**

5. Sonicator control scenarios validate start/stop/reset operations per FR1-FR4
6. MODBUS communication scenarios validate register operations per FR5-FR8
7. Power monitoring scenarios validate measurement and reporting per FR9-FR10
8. Safety and error handling scenarios validate fault conditions per FR11-FR12

**Test Execution and Reporting:**

9. `make test-acceptance` executes complete BDD suite with hardware validation
10. BDD test results provide clear pass/fail status with requirement traceability
11. Acceptance test execution completes within <15 minutes for complete suite
12. Test reports include PRD requirement coverage analysis and gaps identification

## Technical Implementation Details

### BDD Framework Structure

```gherkin
# test/acceptance/features/sonicator_control.feature
Feature: Sonicator Control Operations
  As a PLC operator
  I want to control sonicator operations via MODBUS
  So that I can manage ultrasonic cleaning processes

  @requirement_FR1
  Scenario: Start sonicator operation
    Given the Multi-Sonicator system is initialized
    And sonicator 1 is in stopped state
    When I send MODBUS command to start sonicator 1
    Then sonicator 1 status indicates running
    And START_1 signal is asserted on PC6
    And sonicator power monitoring shows active power draw
```

### Requirement Mapping Structure

```text
Traceability is primarily driven by Behave tags already present in the feature files, e.g. @requirement_FR1.
Optionally, a simple mapping module may be added under:
  test/acceptance/requirement_mapping.py
to aggregate tags → requirement IDs for reporting.
```

### BDD Integration with HIL

```python
# test/acceptance/steps/sonicator_steps.py
from behave import given, when, then

@given("the Multi-Sonicator system is initialized")
def step_system_initialized(context):
    # HIL environment and hardware_interface are prepared in test/acceptance/environment.py
    assert hasattr(context, "hardware_interface"), "HIL hardware interface not available"

@when("I send MODBUS command to start sonicator 1")
def step_modbus_start_sonicator(context):
    # Uses the existing interface pattern found in hil_modbus_steps.py
    reg_addr = 0x0010  # example register for START command
    ok = context.hardware_interface.modbus_write_register(reg_addr, 1)
    assert ok, "MODBUS write failed"
```

### Recommended Status

**⏳ PENDING DEPENDENCY** — Proceed after Story 0.2 completion.

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete Story 0.2 (HIL Test Harness)

3. Monitor runtime to validate the <15 minutes performance target
### Additional QA Review — 2025-09-16
- Hardware verification may be deferred for now. Proceed with BDD framework setup, PRD mapping, CI wiring, and scenario scaffolding; mark HIL-bound steps @pending.
- Resolve any residual duplication with `0.3.bdd-acceptance-testing-framework.md` per gate guidance. If already resolved, ensure a note is added to the Change Log.
- Keep reports aligned to `docs/sop/sw-testing.md` and `docs/sop/release-format.md`.
