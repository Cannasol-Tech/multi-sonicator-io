# Story 5.3: Monitoring & Alerting Systems Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-5.3
**Epic**: Epic 5: Production Deployment & Operations
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: DevOps Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want comprehensive real-time production monitoring with proactive alerting,
So that I can quickly identify and respond to system issues before they impact operations.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing MODBUS communication layer, Web UI monitoring, and HIL framework
- Technology: Monitoring agents, alerting systems, dashboard tools
- Follows pattern: Real-time data collection with threshold-based alerts
- Touch points: System health metrics, performance counters, error logs

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Real-time system health monitoring with 100% coverage
2. Proactive alerting system with configurable thresholds and notification channels
3. Dashboard visualization of key performance indicators and system status
4. Historical data logging and trend analysis capabilities
5. Alert escalation procedures with defined response times

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New alerting follows established notification patterns and protocols
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Monitoring works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Monitoring coverage >99.9% with minimal blind spots
11. Alert response time <1 second for critical issues
12. No regression in existing monitoring functionality
13. Monitoring code follows project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing monitoring infrastructure with production-grade capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Web UI monitoring from Story 3.3
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within network and security limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting systems operational in production environment
- [ ] Documentation updated with monitoring procedures and alert definitions
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Alert fatigue from excessive notifications causing critical issues to be missed
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent alert filtering and aggregation
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic monitoring with manual alerting

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing monitoring systems
- [ ] Alerting works with current hardware and software configurations
- [ ] Monitoring doesn't impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for dashboard consumption
