# Story 4.9: Load Balancing & Optimization Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-4.9
**Epic**: Epic 4: Multi-Sonicator Coordination & Management
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Performance Engineer
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

Backlog

## User Story

As a system performance engineer,
I want intelligent load balancing and optimization across all sonicator units,
So that power distribution is efficient and system performance is maximized.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing power monitoring, MODBUS communication layer, and HIL framework
- Technology: C/C++ embedded firmware, power measurement algorithms, optimization logic
- Follows pattern: Real-time performance monitoring with adaptive algorithms
- Touch points: Power measurement ADCs, current sensors, MODBUS power registers

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Real-time power consumption monitoring for load balancing across all units
2. Intelligent load distribution algorithms to prevent power system overload
3. Performance optimization for concurrent operation efficiency
4. Power consumption reporting and trending for each unit
5. Load balancing configuration with adjustable parameters

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing power monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New load balancing follows established performance optimization patterns
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Load balancing works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Load balancing accuracy within ±5% of target power distribution
11. Optimization algorithms complete within 100ms of load changes
12. No regression in existing single-unit performance functionality
13. Optimization code follows project performance standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing power monitoring with load balancing algorithms
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Single-unit performance optimization from Story 1.4
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within ATmega32A resource limitations, maintain real-time performance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Load balancing operational for all 4 sonicator units
- [ ] Documentation updated with optimization procedures and configuration
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Aggressive load balancing causing performance instability
- **Mitigation**: Implement conservative algorithms with configurable parameters
- **Rollback**: Revert to fixed power distribution with manual configuration

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing power monitoring systems
- [ ] Load balancing works with coordinated operation modes
- [ ] Performance optimization doesn't interfere with safety systems
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for MODBUS and Web UI consumption
