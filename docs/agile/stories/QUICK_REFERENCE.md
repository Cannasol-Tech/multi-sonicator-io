## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Current Project Health**
- **Completion Rate**: 8% (2/25 stories)
- **Quality Gates Passed**: 3/4 reviewed stories  
- **Critical Path Progress**: Epic 0 at 11%
- **Test Coverage Issues**: 2 stories need attention

### **Target Metrics**
- **Epic 0 Completion**: Target end of month
- **Test Coverage**: ≥85% for all stories
- **QA Gate Pass Rate**: >90%
- **Dependency Resolution**: <24 hours for blockers

---

## 🆘 **Escalation Path**

### **If Story 0.2 Coverage Issues Persist**
1. **Immediate**: Assign senior developer to unit test implementation
2. **Escalate**: Contact Test Architect (Quinn) for guidance
3. **Alternative**: Consider reducing coverage requirement with architectural review

### **If Story 3.0 Coverage Gap Grows**  
1. **Immediate**: Focus on TestAutomationService.py specific lines
2. **Escalate**: Web UI development lead for code review
3. **Alternative**: Add integration tests if unit tests insufficient

### **For General Blockers**
1. **Daily Standups**: Surface blockers immediately
2. **Scrum Master**: Coordinate dependency resolution  
3. **Product Owner**: Prioritize and remove scope if needed
