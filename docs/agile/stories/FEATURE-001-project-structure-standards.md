**Story ID**: S-0.1
**Feature**: F-001: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: Product Owner (Sarah)
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

**COMPLETED** - 2025-09-10

✅ All acceptance criteria met
✅ All tasks completed  
✅ Standards compliance validated
✅ Ready for Story 0.2 (CI/CD Pipeline)

## Story

**As a** development team member,
**I want** the project structure to fully comply with Axovia Flow company standards,
**so that** we maintain consistency, quality, and enable automated validation across all development workflows.

## Feature Context

**Feature F-001: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence**

- Goal: Establish comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and ensure complete adherence to company release standards
- Creates foundational infrastructure for reliable firmware development and quality assurance

## Story Context

**Company Standards Integration:**

- Axovia Flow company standards for project structure, coding style, and testing
- Standards automatically synchronized and enforced
- Quality gates ensuring standards compliance

**Integration Points:**

- `.axovia-flow/company-standards/` directory structure
- Make targets for standards validation
- Automated standards compliance checking

## Acceptance Criteria

**Standards Compliance Requirements:**

1. Project structure exactly matches `.axovia-flow/company-standards/project-structure.md` specification
2. All required directories and files per company standards are present and properly organized
3. `make update-standards` successfully synchronizes latest company standards (remote or local fallback)
4. `make check-standards` passes all validation checks without errors or warnings

**Directory Structure Requirements:**

5. Root directory structure follows company standards specification
6. Documentation hierarchy matches prescribed organization
7. Source code organization aligns with embedded systems standards
8. Testing directory structure supports three-stage testing pyramid

**Quality Validation Requirements:**

9. Standards compliance automated in CI/CD pipeline
10. All standards violations prevent merge to main branch
11. Standards status clearly reported in build outputs
12. Documentation reflects current standards compliance status

## Technical Implementation Details

### Required Company Standards Integration

```bash
# Standards synchronization and validation
make update-standards     # Sync latest standards (remote or local fallback)
make check-standards      # Validate compliance with all standards
```

### Expected Directory Compliance

- Root directory structure per `.axovia-flow/company-standards/root-directory.md`
- Project structure per `.axovia-flow/company-standards/project-structure.md`
- Coding standards per `.axovia-flow/company-standards/coding-style.md`
- Testing standards per `.axovia-flow/company-standards/sw-testing-standard.md`

### Standards Enforcement

- Automated compliance checking in CI pipeline
- Pre-commit hooks for standards validation
- Clear reporting of standards violations
- Automated remediation suggestions where possible

  - [x] Test CI integration readiness

## Dev Notes

### Company Standards Information

**Standards Files Location:** `.axovia-flow/company-standards/`

**Key Standards Documents:**
- `coding-style.md`: Code formatting and style requirements
- `project-structure.md`: Directory and file organization standards
- `sw-testing-standard.md`: Testing methodology and structure requirements

**Standards Synchronization:**
- Primary: Remote standards repository synchronization
- Fallback: Local company standards preservation
- Validation: Automated compliance checking against current standards

### Testing Standards

**Test File Location:** `test/unit/test_standards_compliance.cpp`

**Testing Framework:** Unity Test Framework

**Testing Requirements:**
- Validate directory structure compliance
- Verify standards file integrity
- Test make target functionality
- Validate CI integration readiness

**Specific Testing Patterns:**
- Structure validation against standards specification
- Make target execution and output validation
- Standards synchronization testing (remote and fallback modes)

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing project structure and configuration
- Access to company standards repository
- Make system configured
