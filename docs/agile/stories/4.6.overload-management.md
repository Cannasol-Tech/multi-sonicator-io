# Story 4.6: Overload Management Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-4.6
**Epic**: Epic 4: Multi-Sonicator Coordination & Management
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: Technical Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a system safety engineer,
I want automatic overload detection, isolation, and recovery for each sonicator unit,
So that equipment damage is prevented and system uptime is maximized through intelligent fault handling.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing safety systems, MODBUS communication layer, and HIL framework
- Technology: C/C++ embedded firmware, ADC monitoring, GPIO interrupt handling
- Follows pattern: Hardware-based overload detection with software coordination
- Touch points: Overload detection pins, safety interlock systems, MODBUS error reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Overload detection for all 4 sonicator units with <100ms response time
2. Automatic isolation of overloaded units without affecting other units
3. Automatic recovery procedures after overload conditions clear
4. Overload status reporting through MODBUS registers and status flags
5. Emergency stop integration for critical overload conditions

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing safety systems extended without breaking changes
7. New overload management follows established safety patterns and protocols
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Overload handling works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Overload detection accuracy >99.9% with minimal false positives
11. Recovery procedures complete within 5 seconds of overload clearance
12. No regression in existing single-unit overload handling functionality
13. Safety code follows project safety standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing overload detection with multi-unit coordination
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Single-sonicator overload handling from Story 1.4
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within hardware safety requirements, maintain real-time response

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Overload management operational for all 4 sonicator units
- [ ] Documentation updated with safety procedures and fault handling
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Overly sensitive overload detection causing unnecessary unit shutdowns
- **Mitigation**: Implement configurable thresholds and debounce filtering
- **Rollback**: Revert to existing single-unit overload handling

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing safety systems
- [ ] Overload handling works with coordinated operation modes
- [ ] Safety interlocks remain functional during overload conditions
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for MODBUS and Web UI consumption
