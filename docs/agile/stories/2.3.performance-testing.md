# Story 2.3: Performance Testing - MODBUS Timing and Throughput Validation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-2.3  
**Epic**: Epic 2: Testing Infrastructure  
**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: QA Lead  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a QA engineer,
I want a performance testing suite that measures MODBUS response time and throughput,
So that we can ensure the system consistently meets timing requirements (<100ms responses) under realistic and peak loads.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing HIL testing framework and MODBUS communication layer
- Technology: Python-based HIL framework, Arduino Uno R4 WiFi test wrapper, ATmega32A DUT
- Follows pattern: Performance and latency measurement leveraging existing HIL test harness utilities
- Touch points: MODBUS read/write operations, command sequencing, error handling, CI test reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Implement automated performance tests that measure MODBUS response times for common commands across normal and peak load scenarios
2. Implement throughput tests to quantify sustained requests-per-second without errors
3. Collect timing distributions (P50, P90, P95, P99) and average/standard deviation for each test scenario
4. Generate machine-readable reports (e.g., JSON) and human-readable summaries (Markdown/HTML) for CI artifacts
5. Provide configurable thresholds for pass/fail (default: response time <100ms for P95)

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Tests run via existing commands (e.g., `make test-performance` or integrated into `make test` with a flag)
7. Works with real hardware and simulated environments without code changes (config-driven)
8. Integrates with CI/CD to publish performance artifacts per build without breaking existing pipelines

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Tests are deterministic and repeatable; minimize flakiness with sufficient warmup and sample sizes
10. Results validated across at least three consecutive runs within ±10% variance in CI environment
11. Test code follows project coding standards and is documented
12. No regression to existing HIL or unit/integration tests verified

## Technical Notes

- **Measurement Approach:** Use monotonic clock timing around MODBUS request/response boundaries, include warmup phase, and capture sample sizes large enough to represent steady-state (e.g., >= 200 samples per command)
- **Throughput Strategy:** Use controlled concurrency (configurable) to measure maximum sustainable rate without errors; capture error rates and timeouts
- **Reporting:** Emit JSON metrics and generate Markdown summary tables with key percentiles; store under `test/data/results/` (or as configured)
- **Configuration:** Centralize thresholds and scenarios in a YAML/JSON config; allow overrides via environment variables for CI
- **Safety:** Ensure tests avoid unsafe operations on hardware (e.g., limit duty cycles, include cooling intervals if needed)
- **Dependencies:** Reuse existing HIL utilities for setup/teardown, logging, and device selection (real vs simulated)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-8 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 9-12 satisfied
- [ ] Performance tests integrated into CI and producing artifacts on each run
- [ ] Documentation updated with execution instructions and thresholds configuration
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Hardware variability and environment noise may cause timing fluctuations
- **Mitigation:** Use simulation for baseline; run multiple repetitions; apply warmups and control for background load
- **Rollback:** Disable performance suite via feature flag while maintaining existing HIL tests

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing HIL framework or CI commands
- [ ] Works with both real hardware and simulated environments
- [ ] Artifacts use existing CI storage conventions and do not bloat storage
- [ ] Thresholds configurable without code changes

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement latency measurement harness for MODBUS commands with warmup and steady-state sampling (AC: 1, 3, 9)
  - [ ] Capture per-command timing using monotonic clocks and record raw samples
  - [ ] Compute P50, P90, P95, P99, avg, stddev per scenario
- [ ] Implement throughput benchmark with configurable concurrency and duration (AC: 2, 9)
  - [ ] Measure sustainable RPS without errors; record error/timeouts
- [ ] Emit machine-readable JSON metrics and human-readable Markdown/HTML summaries (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Store artifacts under `test/data/results/` with build/run identifiers
- [ ] Add configuration for thresholds and scenarios with env-var overrides (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Default P95 threshold < 100ms; allow overrides via CI env
- [ ] Provide Makefile/CI integration to execute performance suite and publish artifacts (AC: 6, 8)
  - [ ] Expose target `make test-performance` or equivalent flag under `make test`
- [ ] Ensure config-driven real vs simulated execution parity (AC: 7)
- [ ] Flakiness mitigation: warmup, sample size, multi-run variance within ±10% (AC: 9–10)
- [ ] Documentation updates for execution steps and thresholds management (AC: 11)
- [ ] Verify no regressions to HIL/unit/integration tests (AC: 12)

## Dev Notes

- Relevant Source Tree
  - Performance artifacts directory: `test/data/results/`
  - HIL utilities: see `test/hil/` and `test/integration/` for patterns; reuse setup/teardown and logging
  - Configuration: consider `config/` for new `perf-test.yaml` (thresholds, scenarios), with env override support
- Patterns and Standards
  - Follow existing HIL test patterns from stories `2.0` and `2.2`
  - Coding style per `docs/sop/coding-style.md`
  - Testing SOPs per `docs/sop/sw-testing.md`
- CI Integration
  - Add CI step to run performance suite conditionally (e.g., on main or nightly) and upload artifacts
  - Ensure no pipeline breaks; artifacts retained but size-controlled

### Testing

- Frameworks/Approach
  - Use pytest-based harness or existing HIL framework components for orchestration
  - Monotonic clock for timing; warmup runs excluded from metrics
- Scenarios (examples)
  - Read coil/register, write coil/register, burst read/write sequences
  - Concurrency levels: 1, 2, 4 (configurable)
  - Samples: warmup 20, measure 200+ per scenario
- Metrics/Artifacts
  - JSON: percentile stats, RPS, error/timeouts counts, timestamps
  - Markdown/HTML: summary tables per scenario for CI report
- Thresholds
  - Defaults: P95 < 100ms; configurable via `perf-test.yaml` and environment overrides
