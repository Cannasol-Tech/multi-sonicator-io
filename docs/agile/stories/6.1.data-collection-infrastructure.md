# Story 6.1: Data Collection Infrastructure Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-6.1
**Epic**: Epic 6: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Data Analytics Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a data engineer,
I want real-time metrics collection and storage infrastructure,
So that all sonicator performance data is captured and available for analysis.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing MODBUS communication layer, monitoring systems, and Web UI
- Technology: Data collection agents, storage systems, communication protocols
- Follows pattern: Real-time data ingestion with reliable storage
- Touch points: Sensor readings, performance metrics, system logs

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Real-time data collection for all sonicator metrics from all 4 units
2. Reliable data storage infrastructure with minimal data loss
3. Data collection with configurable sampling rates and intervals
4. Data validation and quality checking mechanisms
5. Data retention and archiving policies with automated management

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing monitoring systems extended without breaking changes
7. New data collection follows established communication patterns and protocols
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Data collection works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Data collection uptime >99.9% with <1% data loss
11. Data validation accuracy >99.5% with minimal errors
12. No regression in existing monitoring functionality
13. Data collection follows project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing monitoring infrastructure with data collection capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Real-time monitoring from Story 4.5
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within storage and network limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Data collection infrastructure operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with data collection procedures and storage details
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Data collection overhead impacting system performance
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient data collection with configurable sampling rates
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic monitoring with manual data collection

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing monitoring systems
- [ ] Data collection works with current hardware and software configurations
- [ ] Collection doesn't significantly impact system performance
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for analysis and storage
