<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-8.8

**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Risk Manager

## User Story

As a risk manager,
I want hazard analysis and safety measures documentation,
So that I can ensure comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation measures are documented for compliance.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing risk management systems, hazard analysis, and safety documentation
- Technology: Risk assessment tools, hazard analysis methods, mitigation tracking
- Follows pattern: Systematic risk evaluation with mitigation planning
- Touch points: Hazard scenarios, risk metrics, safety controls

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Comprehensive hazard analysis with systematic risk identification
2. Safety measures documentation with mitigation strategies and controls
3. Risk assessment with quantitative analysis and scoring
4. Mitigation tracking with implementation monitoring and verification
5. Documentation validation with completeness and accuracy checking

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing risk systems extended without breaking changes
7. New assessment follows established risk patterns and standards
8. Integration with current hazard analysis and safety documentation
9. Assessment works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Risk assessment completeness >99% with proper hazard coverage
11. Mitigation effectiveness >95% with proper control implementation
12. No regression in existing risk management functionality
13. Assessment follows project standards and safety practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing risk infrastructure with assessment capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Safety interlock systems from Story 4.8
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within risk management and safety requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with assessment procedures and mitigation guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Assessment gaps causing compliance failures or safety issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive analysis and systematic verification
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual risk assessment with basic documentation

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing risk systems
- [ ] Assessment works with current risk and safety configurations
- [ ] Evaluation doesn't significantly impact development processes
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for compliance submission
