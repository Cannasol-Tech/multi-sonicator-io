# Story 0.4: Documentation & Release Standards

**Story ID**: S-0.4
**Feature**: F-001: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Product Owner (Sarah)
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** release manager,
**I want** automated documentation generation and standardized release packaging,
**so that** releases are compliant, repeatable, and consumable by engineering and stakeholders.

## Feature Context

**Feature #001: CI/CD Pipeline & Release Standard Adherence**

- Goal: Establish comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and ensure complete adherence to company release standards
- Produces consistent documentation and release artifacts

## Story Context

**Documentation & Release Requirements:**

- Doxygen for API documentation generation
- Release reports per company format
- Semantic Versioning and changelog automation
- Artifact packaging and publication

**Integration Points:**

- Doxygen configuration and generation
- CI pipeline artifact publishing
- Release report generation tooling
- Company standards for release process

## Acceptance Criteria

**Documentation Requirements:**

1. Doxygen configuration generates complete API documentation for public interfaces
2. Documentation builds automatically in CI and on-demand locally (`make docs`)
3. Documentation artifacts are versioned and uploaded as CI artifacts
4. Documentation includes module overviews and usage examples where applicable

**Release Standards Requirements:**

5. Release report generated following company standard format (functionality-report and optional executive-report)
6. Release artifacts include firmware binaries, reports, documentation, and metadata
7. Semantic Versioning applied with automated changelog generation
8. Release packaging validated for completeness and integrity (checksums)

**CI Integration Requirements:**

9. `make ci` includes docs generation and artifact packaging steps
10. Release pipeline triggered on version tags (e.g., vX.Y.Z)
11. CI publishes artifacts to release storage with proper retention
12. Release notes autogenerated and attached to GitHub Releases

## Technical Implementation Details

### Make Targets

```bash
make docs                 # Generate Doxygen documentation
make release-report       # Generate release reports per company standards
make package-release      # Package firmware, docs, and reports
make ci                   # CI pipeline including docs and packaging
```

### Doxygen

- Ensure Doxygen config (.doxyfile) is present and configured
- Include all public headers and documented interfaces
- Generate HTML output with index and module pages

### Release Packaging

- Include firmware binaries, documentation, release report, coverage summaries
- Generate checksums (SHA256) for all artifacts
- Include metadata.json with version, build time, commit SHA

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Doxygen generates complete documentation locally and in CI
- [ ] `make release-report` produces reports per company standard
- [ ] `make package-release` bundles all required artifacts with checksums
- [ ] `make ci` includes docs and packaging stages
- [ ] Version tag builds create GitHub Releases with attached artifacts
- [ ] Semantic Versioning and CHANGELOG automation operational
- [ ] Documentation and release processes documented in README
- [ ] Ready for handoff to next epic

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Doxygen Setup** (AC: 1–4)
  - [ ] Configure `.doxyfile` with proper include paths
  - [ ] Annotate public interfaces with Doxygen comments
  - [ ] Implement `make docs`

- [ ] **Task 2: Release Reports** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement `make release-report` per company standards
  - [ ] Include functionality-report and optional executive-report

- [ ] **Task 3: Packaging** (AC: 6, 8)
  - [ ] Implement `make package-release` to assemble artifacts
  - [ ] Generate checksums and metadata.json

- [ ] **Task 4: CI Integration** (AC: 9–12)
  - [ ] Extend CI workflow to generate docs and package artifacts
  - [ ] Trigger release on version tags and publish to GitHub Releases
  - [ ] Autogenerate release notes from CHANGELOG

## Dev Notes

- Follow `.axovia-flow/company-standards/release-format.md` (or successor) for report structure
- Ensure Doxygen warnings are treated as errors in CI to maintain quality
- Validate artifact integrity and completeness with automated checks

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 completed
- CI pipeline operational

**Enables:**
- Future epic releases with consistent packaging
