  @hil @hardware
  Scenario: Digital Output Control
    Given the ATmega32A is programmed with test firmware

  Scenario: Digital Input Reading
    Given the ATmega32A is programmed with test firmware

    Then the register value should be valid
    And the response time should be less than 100ms
    And the CRC should be correct
    
  @hil @modbus @hardware
  Scenario: Write and Verify Control Register
    When I write value 1 to MODBUS register 0x0010 (global enable)
    Then reading register 0x0010 should return value 1
    And the register change should be reflected within 100ms
    And the system status should update accordingly
    
  @hil @modbus @hardware  
  Scenario: Communication Fault Detection
    Given the MODBUS communication is established
    When I disconnect the communication cable
    And wait for 2 seconds
    Then the system should detect communication fault
    And enter failsafe mode per FR11 requirements
```

#### Integration with Existing Test Structure

The HIL framework operates within your existing acceptance test structure:

- **`test/acceptance/environment.py`** - Enhanced with HIL controller setup
- **`test/acceptance/features/`** - New `.feature` files for hardware scenarios  
- **`test/acceptance/steps/`** - HIL-specific step definitions
- **All acceptance tests require real hardware** - No emulation alternatives

### BDD Feature Examples for HIL Testing

#### Basic Connectivity Feature (`test/acceptance/features/hil_basic_connectivity.feature`)

```gherkin
Feature: Hardware Basic Connectivity
  As a firmware developer
  I want to verify basic hardware connectivity  
  So that I can ensure the HIL framework can communicate with the ATmega32A

  Background:
    Given the Arduino test harness is connected
    And the ATmega32A target is powered
    And the HIL framework is initialized

  Scenario: Power supply verification
    When I measure the power supply voltages
    Then the 24V input should be within tolerance
    And the 5V rail should be 5.0V ± 0.1V
    And the 3.3V rail should be 3.3V ± 0.1V

  Scenario: Programming interface verification  
    When I attempt to program the ATmega32A via Arduino as ISP
    Then the programming should succeed
    And the firmware version should be readable
    And the target should respond to commands

  Scenario: Serial communication establishment
    When I establish serial communication with the target
    Then I should receive a valid response
    And the communication should be stable for 10 seconds
```

#### GPIO Functionality Feature (`test/acceptance/features/hil_gpio_functionality.feature`)

```gherkin
Feature: GPIO Hardware Functionality
  As a firmware developer
  I want to verify GPIO pin control and monitoring
  So that I can ensure sonicator interface pins work correctly

  Background:
    Given the HIL framework is connected to ATmega32A
    And the GPIO HAL is loaded on the target

  Scenario: Digital output control
    When I set pin "PC0" to HIGH via HIL framework
    Then the pin voltage should be approximately 5.0V
    When I set pin "PC0" to LOW via HIL framework  
    Then the pin voltage should be approximately 0.0V

  Scenario: Digital input reading
    Given pin "PD3" is configured as input with pull-up
    When I apply 0V to pin "PD3" externally
    Then reading pin "PD3" should return LOW
    When I disconnect the external connection
    Then reading pin "PD3" should return HIGH

  Scenario: Pin state persistence
    When I set multiple pins to specific states
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    Then all pin states should remain unchanged
```

#### MODBUS Communication Feature (`test/acceptance/features/hil_modbus_communication.feature`)

```gherkin
Feature: MODBUS RTU Communication
  As a PLC integration engineer
  I want to verify MODBUS RTU communication via HIL
  So that I can ensure the sonicator control interface works correctly

  Background:
    Given the MODBUS RTU slave is running on ATmega32A
    And the HIL framework acts as MODBUS master
    And communication is established at 115200 baud

  Scenario: Register read operations
    When I read register "0x0000" (system status)
    Then I should receive a valid response
    And the response time should be less than 100ms
    
  Scenario: Register write operations  
    When I write value "1" to register "0x0100" (sonicator start)
    Then the write should succeed
    And reading the register should return "1"
    
  Scenario: CRC validation
    When I send a request with invalid CRC
    Then the slave should not respond
    When I send a request with valid CRC
    Then the slave should respond correctly

  Scenario: Communication timeout handling
    When I stop sending MODBUS requests for 2 seconds
    Then the communication fault flag should be set
    And the failsafe mode should activate
```

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Arduino Uno R4 WiFi configured as ISP programmer
- ATmega32A target hardware assembled and powered
- Hardware pin assignments verified against `docs/planning/pin-matrix.md` (SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- Python 3.8+ with PySerial, modbus-tk, pytest packages
- USB serial adapters for communication
- Basic test equipment (multimeter, optional oscilloscope)

### Enables Next Stories

- Epic 1 Story 1: Project Structure (with HIL verification)

- Epic 1 Story 4: Single Sonicator Control (with HIL hardware testing)

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Hardware setup complexity and Arduino as ISP reliability issues
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive setup documentation and backup programming methods
**Verification:** Successful firmware programming and communication establishment

**Secondary Risk:** Test framework complexity may slow development
**Mitigation:** Start with minimal viable framework and expand incrementally
**Verification:** Basic connectivity tests operational before advanced features

**Third Risk:** Hardware availability and setup time requirements
**Mitigation:** Document exact hardware requirements and setup procedures
**Verification:** Complete hardware setup guide with troubleshooting steps

## Notes

- HIL framework must be simple and reliable for continuous use
- Focus on essential hardware validation over comprehensive test coverage initially
- Framework supports manual testing and requires real hardware for CI/CD
- All timing-critical tests must account for hardware response delays
- Test results must be deterministic and repeatable for reliable verification
- Framework will be extended as Epic 1 stories are implemented and require verification
- **Hardware-only approach** - No emulation alternatives supported
- **Pin assignments must strictly follow `docs/planning/pin-matrix.md`** - Any deviations require pin matrix updates first
