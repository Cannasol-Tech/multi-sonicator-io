<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-8.1

**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: Compliance Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a compliance officer,
I want industrial automation standards adherence framework,
So that I can ensure full compliance with IEC 61131 and IEC 61508 requirements for legal deployment.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing development processes, quality management systems, and documentation infrastructure
- Technology: Compliance frameworks, standards documentation, verification tools
- Follows pattern: Systematic compliance with established industrial standards
- Touch points: Development processes, quality procedures, regulatory requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Industrial automation standards compliance framework for IEC 61131 and IEC 61508
2. Compliance verification procedures with systematic checking
3. Standards documentation with requirement mapping and traceability
4. Development process integration with compliance checkpoints
5. Compliance monitoring with ongoing assessment and reporting

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing development processes extended without breaking changes
7. New framework follows established compliance patterns and procedures
8. Integration with current quality management systems
9. Framework works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Standards compliance verification >99% with minimal gaps
11. Documentation completeness >95% with proper requirement mapping
12. No regression in existing development functionality
13. Compliance framework follows project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing development infrastructure with compliance capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Quality management integration from Story 8.7
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within development process and quality management limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Standards compliance framework operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with compliance procedures and verification guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Compliance gaps causing certification delays or failures
- **Mitigation**: Implement systematic verification and continuous assessment
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual compliance with basic verification

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing development processes
- [ ] Framework works with current quality management and documentation configurations
- [ ] Compliance doesn't significantly impact development velocity
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for regulatory submission
