## User Story

As a product owner and QA lead,
I want ≥85% unit test coverage and complete Doxygen documentation,
so that quality gates are satisfied and the system is maintainable.

## Scope

- Raise overall unit test statement coverage to ≥85%
- Ensure acceptance tests run on physical hardware pass reliably
- Generate complete Doxygen documentation and review for accuracy
- Produce test and documentation reports per company standards

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit test coverage ≥85% (statement) with report artifacts
2. All acceptance BDD tests pass on hardware at least once consecutively
3. Doxygen documentation generated without warnings and reviewed
4. Reports adhere to `docs/standards/sw-testing-standard.md` and `docs/standards/release-report.md`
5. Regression log policy followed for any failures (`REGRESSION-ISSUES.md` if needed)

## Tasks

- [ ] Add/expand unit tests to reach ≥85% coverage; commit reports
- [ ] Execute `make test-acceptance` with hardware attached; collect logs
- [ ] Fix failing tests or document regressions with root-cause analysis
- [ ] Configure and run Doxygen; resolve warnings; publish artifacts
- [ ] Update testing and documentation sections in README as needed

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Coverage report shows ≥85% and is stored in CI artifact
- [ ] Acceptance tests pass and logs are archived under `test/acceptance/logs/`
- [ ] Doxygen HTML generated and reviewed; warnings = 0
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect current state
