# Story 5.8: Remote Diagnostics Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-5.8
**Epic**: Epic 5: Production Deployment & Operations
**Priority**: Medium
**Owner**: Support Engineer
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a support engineer,
I want remote diagnostics and maintenance capabilities,
So that I can quickly resolve issues without requiring on-site visits and enable 90% remote issue resolution.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing Web UI, MODBUS communication layer, and deployment system
- Technology: Remote access tools, diagnostic utilities, maintenance scripts
- Follows pattern: Secure remote access with diagnostic capabilities
- Touch points: System logs, configuration data, performance metrics, error reports

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Secure remote diagnostics capabilities with authentication and authorization
2. Remote maintenance procedures with safe operation controls
3. Diagnostic data collection and transmission mechanisms
4. Remote troubleshooting tools with guided procedures
5. Support session logging and audit trail capabilities

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing remote access systems extended without breaking changes
7. New diagnostics follow established remote access patterns and protocols
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Remote diagnostics work with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Remote diagnostics success rate >90% with minimal connection failures
11. Diagnostic session establishment time <30 seconds
12. No regression in existing remote access functionality
13. Remote tools follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing Web UI with remote diagnostics capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Web UI remote access from Story 3.1
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within network security limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Remote diagnostics capabilities operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with remote procedures and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in remote access system
- **Mitigation**: Implement strong authentication, encryption, and access controls
- **Rollback**: Revert to local diagnostics with on-site support

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing remote access systems
- [ ] Remote diagnostics work with current network and security configurations
- [ ] Diagnostic tools don't interfere with normal operations
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for support and auditing
