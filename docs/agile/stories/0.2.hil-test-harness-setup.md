## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- **HIL Framework**: Custom test harness with Arduino Test Wrapper
- **Test Execution**: Automated via CI/CD with manual override capability
- **Hardware Validation**: All tests must pass on physical hardware
- **Safety Requirements**: Emergency stop within 100ms, overload protection
- **Test Isolation**: Each test must reset hardware to known state

### Architecture Context
- **Test Hardware**: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi as ISP programmer and test wrapper
- **DUT**: ATmega32A Sonicator Multiplexer (32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM)
- **Communication**: UART for test control, ISP for firmware programming
- **Power System**: 24V input → 12V → 5V regulation cascade
- **Interfaces**: 4x DB9 sonicator interfaces + 1x DB9 MODBUS communication

### Technical Constraints
- **Hardware Limitations**: Physical hardware availability for testing
- **Timing Requirements**: Real-time signal generation and monitoring
- **Safety Critical**: Must prevent hardware damage during testing
- **Environmental**: Industrial temperature and EMC considerations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% test harness uptime requirement

### File Locations

- **Test Wrapper**: test/wrapper/ (Arduino test wrapper firmware)
- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml (pin assignments)
- **Test Scripts**: test/scripts/ (automation and execution scripts)
- **Test Data**: test/data/ (test results and logs)

### Hardware Pin Matrix Reference
- **Source of Truth**: config/hardware-config.yaml
- **Arduino Pins**: Digital I/O, analog inputs, PWM outputs
- **ATmega32A Pins**: GPIO, ADC, PWM, UART interfaces
- **DB9 Connections**: Sonicator interfaces and MODBUS communication
- **Power Pins**: 24V input, 12V/5V regulation monitoring

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Current Status Assessment

STORY STATUS: Ready for Review — CONCERNS IDENTIFIED

- Primary issue: Unit test coverage is below the required 85% threshold; several tests are placeholders with minimal assertions.
- Architecture: Strong separation of concerns; harness design appears sound and consistent with project standards.
- Implementation completeness: Functionally complete for harness setup, but testing gaps and limited physical validation remain.

### Requirements Traceability (AC → Tests)

- AC1–3: Physical setup and ISP interface validated via task checklist; unit tests present but insufficient depth.
- AC4–7: Automation, monitoring, and reporting scaffolds exist; expand assertions and negative cases in unit tests.
- AC8: Safety interlocks implemented; needs physical e-stop timing validation (<100ms) evidence in HIL tests.
- AC9: Pin matrix validation referenced; ensure checks read from `config/hardware-config.yaml` as sole source.
- AC10: CI wiring exists; ensure HIL job produces artifacts and attaches coverage summary.

Gaps: Lack of definitive test evidence for AC3 (firmware upload E2E) and AC8 (timing) on real hardware.

### Code Quality Assessment

- Design: Appropriate modularity and clear responsibilities; good groundwork for long-term maintainability.
- Risks: Timeout constants duplicated in scripts; consider central config to avoid drift.
- Duplication: Minimal; keep mocks/test utilities DRY across modules.

### Test Architecture Assessment

- Coverage: Reported below 85% overall; increase assertions and path coverage in unit tests.
- Levels: Unit vs HIL split is appropriate; add a small number of integration checks around ISP upload.
- Data/mocks: Mocks in `test/mocks/` are a good start; extend for error paths and edge cases.

### NFR Validation (Advisory)

- Performance: E-stop ≤100ms targeted; require physical measurement result captured in artifacts.
- Reliability: Add retry/backoff tests for hardware comms; verify harness recovers to known-good state per test.
- Maintainability: Good documentation; centralize timeouts and serial paths.

### Testability

- Controllability: Good via wrapper; add fixtures to force fault states.
- Observability: Capture serial logs and timing metrics into artifacts for diagnosis.

### Risks and Debt

- TEST-001 (high): Unit test coverage <85% due to placeholders.
- TEST-002 (medium): E-stop timing lacks physical validation artifact.
- TEST-003 (medium): ISP programming E2E test absent.

### Recommendations

Immediate:
- Implement real assertions in placeholder unit tests to reach ≥85%.
- Add physical e-stop timing test and store result in artifacts.
- Add ISP upload smoke test in CI with checksum verification.

Future:
- Externalize timeouts and serial/device configuration.
- Expand negative-path HIL tests (disconnects, brownouts).

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/0.2-hil-test-harness-setup.yml

### Recommended Status

Changes required. Re-review after coverage ≥85% and HIL timing evidence is attached.

- Make: Added `make test-hil-timing` target for quick hardware timing validation
- Coverage: Confirmed unit coverage pipeline artifacts generate successfully (see `coverage/` and `final/`)
- ISP: Added `test/hil/isp_smoke_test.py` and `make isp-smoke-test` for end-to-end Arduino-as-ISP firmware upload and verification

### Completion Notes List
- [x] Implemented actual unit test logic in HIL unit tests (replaced placeholders)
- [x] Added on-hardware emergency stop timing script and Make target
- [x] Verified timing with connected hardware per hardware-config.yaml mapping
 - [ ] Validate unit coverage ≥85% via `make test-unit` and attach coverage report artifacts
- [x] Kept changes minimal and within existing architecture/patterns

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of HIL test framework with comprehensive architecture. The layered approach (HIL Framework → Hardware Abstraction → Test Cases) provides clean separation of concerns. Code follows company standards with proper naming conventions, documentation, and project structure. Hardware abstraction enables both mock and real testing capabilities.

**Strengths:**
- Clean architectural design with dependency injection patterns
- Comprehensive hardware validation and safety interlocks
- Well-structured CI/CD integration with hardware availability checking
- Excellent documentation and inline comments
- Proper configuration management with hardware-config.yaml as single source of truth

### Refactoring Performed

No direct refactoring performed during review, as the existing architecture is well-designed.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✅ **PASS** - Python snake_case naming, proper docstrings, 4-space indentation, import organization
- Project Structure: ✅ **PASS** - Root directory compliance, proper docs/ and test/ organization, config/ usage
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - Three-stage approach implemented but unit test coverage below 85% requirement
- All ACs Met: ✅ **PASS** - All 10 acceptance criteria have corresponding test implementations

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement actual test logic in unit test placeholders (`test_hil_framework.cpp`)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add physical hardware validation for emergency stop timing (<100ms requirement)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add ISP programming validation tests with actual firmware upload
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Extract timeout constants to configuration files
- [ ] **LOW**: Add type hints consistency across remaining Python modules
- [ ] **LOW**: Consider adding integration test for power failure recovery scenarios

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Hardware access controls properly implemented, no sensitive data exposure, safe default states prevent unauthorized operations.

### Performance Considerations

Performance requirements adequately addressed:
- Emergency stop <100ms requirement designed in safety systems
- Appropriate timeouts for hardware operations (5min HIL, 1min hardware check)
- CI/CD pipeline timeout (15min) suitable for HIL complexity
- Resource cleanup prevents memory/handle leaks

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during review - existing implementation architecture is sound.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/0.2-hil-test-harness-setup.yml

### Recommended Status

**[⚠️ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]**

Primary concern is unit test implementation gap. While the HIL framework architecture is excellent and meets all acceptance criteria functionally, the unit test coverage is significantly below the required 85% standard due to placeholder implementations. This must be addressed before production deployment.
