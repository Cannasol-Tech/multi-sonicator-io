## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a process engineer,
I want AI-driven parameter tuning and performance optimization capabilities,
So that I can achieve 15-20% improvement in energy efficiency and operational performance.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing control systems, performance monitoring, and optimization algorithms
- Technology: Autonomous optimization algorithms, parameter tuning, feedback control
- Follows pattern: Adaptive control with continuous improvement
- Touch points: Control parameters, performance metrics, optimization targets

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. AI-driven parameter tuning for optimal sonicator performance
2. Autonomous optimization achieving 15-20% energy efficiency improvement
3. Performance feedback loops with adaptive control adjustments
4. Optimization constraint management with safety boundaries
5. Continuous improvement with learning from operational data

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing control systems extended without breaking changes
7. New optimization follows established control patterns and safety protocols
8. Integration with current HIL framework for testing and validation
9. Optimization works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Optimization impact achieving 15-20% efficiency improvements
11. Control adjustment response time <1 second for standard optimizations
12. No regression in existing control functionality
13. Optimization algorithms follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing control infrastructure with autonomous optimization capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Load balancing and optimization from Story 4.9
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within control system safety and performance limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Autonomous optimization operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with optimization procedures and safety guidelines
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Over-aggressive optimization causing system instability or safety issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement conservative optimization with safety constraints and human oversight
- **Rollback**: Revert to manual parameter tuning with basic optimization

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing control systems
- [ ] Optimization works with current control and safety configurations
- [ ] Autonomous control doesn't significantly impact system stability
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for performance monitoring
