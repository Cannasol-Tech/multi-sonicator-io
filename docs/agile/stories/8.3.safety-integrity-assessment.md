# Story 8.3: Safety Integrity Assessment Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-8.3
**Epic**: Epic 8: Regulatory Compliance & Certification
**Priority**: Critical
**Owner**: Safety Engineer
**Created**: 2025-09-14

## User Story

As a safety engineer,
I want SIL certification and functional safety assessment,
So that I can achieve SIL 2 certification for safety-critical functions and ensure proper hazard protection.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing safety systems, hazard analysis, and certification management
- Technology: Safety integrity assessment tools, hazard analysis methods, certification tracking
- Follows pattern: Systematic safety evaluation with compliance verification
- Touch points: Safety functions, hazard scenarios, certification requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Safety integrity level (SIL 2) certification for safety-critical functions
2. Functional safety analysis with hazard assessment (ISO 13849)
3. Safety function verification with systematic testing and validation
4. Hazard scenario analysis with risk assessment and mitigation
5. Certification tracking with documentation and submission management

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing safety systems extended without breaking changes
7. New assessment follows established safety patterns and procedures
8. Integration with current hazard analysis and certification management
9. Assessment works with both individual and coordinated operation modes

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Safety assessment completeness >99% with proper hazard coverage
11. Certification achievement rate >90% with minimal re-assessment
12. No regression in existing safety functionality
13. Assessment procedures follow project standards and documentation practices

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing safety infrastructure with integrity assessment capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Safety interlock systems from Story 4.8
- **Key Constraints**: Must work within safety system and certification body limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Safety integrity assessment operational and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with assessment procedures and certification guides
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Assessment gaps causing certification delays or safety issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive hazard analysis and systematic verification
- **Rollback**: Revert to basic safety assessment with manual certification management

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing safety systems
- [ ] Assessment works with current safety and certification configurations
- [ ] Evaluation doesn't significantly impact development schedule
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for certification submission
