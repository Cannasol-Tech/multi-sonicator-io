# Story 2.2: Integration Test Suite Implementation
<!-- Generated by •∆• ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ -->

**Story ID**: S-2.2
**Epic**: Epic 2: Testing Infrastructure
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: QA Lead
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Updated**: 2025-09-14

## Status

Backlog

## User Story

As a QA engineer,
I want comprehensive integration tests that validate hardware-software interfaces,
So that I can ensure the system functions correctly when all components are connected and interacting.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing HIL testing framework and MODBUS communication layer
- Technology: Python-based HIL framework, Arduino Uno R4 WiFi test wrapper, ATmega32A DUT
- Follows pattern: Hardware abstraction layer validation with real and simulated devices
- Touch points: MODBUS communication, GPIO interfaces, ADC readings, PWM generation, safety systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Integration tests implemented for all hardware-software interfaces (MODBUS, GPIO, ADC, PWM)
2. Tests validate communication between Arduino test wrapper and ATmega32A DUT
3. Tests cover normal operation, boundary conditions, and error handling scenarios
4. Hardware safety systems validated through integration testing
5. Tests execute successfully via `make test-integration` target

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing HIL framework extended without breaking changes
7. New tests follow existing HIL testing patterns and conventions
8. Integration with CI/CD pipeline maintains current workflow
9. Test execution works with both real hardware and simulated environments

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Tests validate timing requirements for critical operations
11. Tests cover multi-component interaction scenarios
12. No regression in existing HIL functionality verified
13. Test code follows project coding standards

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing HIL framework with additional test cases and validation procedures
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** HIL test structure and organization from Story 2.0 and current HIL implementation
- **Key Constraints:** Must work with available hardware (currently Sonicator 4 single-channel prototype), maintain safety during testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements 1-5 met
- [ ] Integration requirements 6-9 verified
- [ ] Quality requirements 10-13 satisfied
- [ ] Integration tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated with integration test procedures
- [ ] QA review completed and quality gate passed

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Hardware dependency may make tests unreliable or flaky
- **Mitigation:** Implement hardware abstraction, use simulation capabilities, test incrementally
- **Rollback:** Revert to existing HIL test structure without new integration tests

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing HIL framework
- [ ] Tests work with both real hardware and simulated environments
- [ ] Test execution does not impact hardware safety systems
- [ ] Reports generated in standard formats for CI/CD consumption
