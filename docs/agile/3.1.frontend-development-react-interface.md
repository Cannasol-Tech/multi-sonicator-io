# Story 3.1: Frontend Development - React Interface

## Status

Review

## Story

**As a** Sonicator Operator,
**I want** an intuitive React-based web interface for sonicator control and monitoring,
**so that** I can efficiently operate multiple sonicators with real-time feedback and responsive controls accessible from any modern web browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React application with responsive design for desktop and mobile
2. Real-time sonicator status display for all 4 units
3. Individual sonicator control interface (start/stop/amplitude)
4. System overview dashboard with key performance indicators
5. Interactive hardware diagram with visual pin state representation
6. Alert and notification system for faults and status changes
7. [Deferred] User authentication and session management — deferred to Story 3.5; not required for S-3.1 (PO-approved de-scope)
8. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
9. Performance optimization (page load <3s, UI response <500ms)
10. Integration with backend API for hardware communication

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **Test Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests
- **Test Location**: src/__tests__/ for component tests
- **Coverage Target**: ≥85% component and function coverage
- **E2E Testing**: Cypress for end-to-end user workflow testing
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated accessibility testing with axe-core

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or React Context for global state
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI or Ant Design for consistent design
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for live updates, REST API for commands
- **Build System**: Vite or Create React App with optimization

### Technical Constraints

- **Performance**: Page load <3s, UI responsiveness <500ms
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile Responsive**: Tablet and smartphone compatibility
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for industrial environments
- **Security**: Secure authentication and session management

### File Locations
- **React Source**: src/components/ (React components)
- **Pages**: src/pages/ (main application pages)
- **Services**: src/services/ (API and WebSocket clients)
- **Tests**: src/__tests__/ (component and integration tests)
- **Assets**: src/assets/ (images, icons, styles)

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Sonicator Control Component Interface
interface SonicatorControlProps {
  sonicatorId: number;
  status: SonicatorStatus;
  onStart: (id: number) => void;
  onStop: (id: number) => void;
  onAmplitudeChange: (id: number, amplitude: number) => void;
}

// System Status Interface
interface SystemStatus {
  activeSonicatorCount: number;
  activeSonicatorMask: number;
  totalPowerConsumption: number;
  systemHealth: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'fault';
  lastUpdate: Date;
}
```

### Real-time Data Flow
- **WebSocket Connection**: Persistent connection for live updates
- **State Synchronization**: Automatic UI updates from hardware changes
- **Command Feedback**: Immediate UI feedback with backend confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user notification
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality when connection is lost

### Hardware Visualization
- **Interactive Diagram**: SVG-based hardware representation
- **Pin State Indicators**: Color-coded pin status (high/low/fault)
- **Connection Status**: Visual indication of hardware connectivity
- **Fault Highlighting**: Clear indication of hardware faults
- **Responsive Design**: Scalable for different screen sizes

### User Experience Design
- **Intuitive Controls**: Clear, accessible control interfaces
- **Status Indicators**: Immediate visual feedback for all operations
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages and guidance
- **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators for all operations
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Safety confirmations for critical operations

### Previous Story Insights
- Depends on backend API development for hardware communication
- Foundation for all user interaction with the sonicator system
- Must integrate with HIL testing framework for validation
- Critical for operator efficiency and system usability

#### Quality Gate Assessment

**Gate Status**: CONCERNS - Implementation complete but critical test failures prevent production readiness.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Functional Implementation**: Complete React 19 + TypeScript frontend with all major features
- ✅ **Architecture Quality**: Excellent component design and integration with existing system
- ✅ **Feature Completeness**: 9 of 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented
- ❌ **Test Quality**: 179 failing tests out of 468 total (38% failure rate)
- ❌ **Coverage Gap**: Test coverage below 85% requirement due to test failures
- ⚠️ **Requirements Clarity**: Authentication (AC 7) marked as "not required" but specified in criteria

**Critical Issues Requiring Resolution:**
1. **TEST-001 (High)**: 179 failing frontend tests with critical component failures
2. **TEST-002 (Medium)**: Test coverage below 85% target requirement
3. **REQ-001 (Medium)**: Authentication requirement ambiguity needs clarification

**Implementation Strengths:**
- Complete React frontend with real-time WebSocket communication
- Interactive hardware diagram with pin state visualization
- Responsive design with modern build system (Vite)
- Comprehensive component architecture
- Successful integration with Story 3.0 Web UI

**Immediate Actions Required:**
- Fix Header component test failures (connection status, theme toggle)
- Resolve TestResultsModal DOM element errors
- Fix AdvancedControlPanel test element queries
- Achieve 85% test coverage requirement

**Recommendation**: Address test failures before production deployment. The implementation quality is excellent, but test reliability must be established for confident release.
