## Epic Summary

Implement comprehensive multi-sonicator coordination capabilities enabling simultaneous control and monitoring of up to 4 CT2000 sonicator units. This epic extends the foundational single-sonicator control to provide scalable multi-unit management with advanced coordination logic, safety features, and performance optimization.

## Scope Definition

### EXACTLY What Will Be Implemented

- Multi-sonicator state machine coordination for up to 4 units simultaneously
- Individual sonicator control (start/stop/amplitude) with independent operation
- Coordinated start/stop sequences with configurable timing and safety interlocks
- Advanced amplitude control with per-unit setpoint management and ramping
- Real-time power consumption monitoring and load balancing across units
- Frequency monitoring and automatic frequency lock detection per unit
- Overload detection, isolation, and automatic recovery procedures
- Active sonicator count tracking and bitmask status reporting
- Connected sonicator auto-detection and dynamic configuration
- Multi-unit safety interlocks and emergency shutdown capabilities
- Performance optimization for concurrent operation efficiency
- Load distribution algorithms to prevent power system overload

### EXACTLY What Will NOT Be Implemented

- Advanced analytics or historical data logging (Epic 6)
- Predictive maintenance algorithms (Epic 7)
- Remote diagnostics beyond basic status reporting
- Third-party system integrations beyond MODBUS
- Advanced user interface features (Epic 3 scope)

## Business Value
