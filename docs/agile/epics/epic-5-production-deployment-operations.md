- Performance monitoring and capacity planning tools
- Security hardening and access control procedures
- Compliance documentation and audit trail systems
- Remote diagnostics and support capabilities
- Production incident response procedures and escalation paths

### EXACTLY What Will NOT Be Implemented

- Advanced analytics dashboards (Epic 6 scope)
- Predictive maintenance algorithms (Epic 7 scope)
- Third-party system integrations beyond MODBUS
- Advanced user training programs (operational scope)
- Manufacturing process automation (hardware scope)

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Deployment pipeline failures could cause production downtime
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, rollback procedures, and blue-green deployment strategies

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in production environment
**Mitigation**: Security hardening, regular audits, and penetration testing

**Risk**: Monitoring system failures could mask production issues
**Mitigation**: Redundant monitoring systems with independent alerting channels

**Risk**: Inadequate backup procedures could result in data loss
**Mitigation**: Automated backup testing and regular recovery drills

**Risk**: Insufficient operational documentation could delay issue resolution
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation with regular updates and validation
