## Epic Summary

Establish comprehensive regulatory compliance and certification framework for the Multi-Sonicator I/O Controller system to meet industrial automation standards, safety requirements, and regulatory mandates. This epic ensures the system meets all necessary compliance requirements for deployment in regulated industrial environments.

## Scope Definition

### EXACTLY What Will Be Implemented

- Industrial automation standards compliance (IEC 61131, IEC 61508)
- Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing and certification (IEC 61000 series)
- Safety integrity level (SIL) assessment and certification
- Functional safety analysis and hazard assessment (ISO 13849)
- Environmental compliance testing (temperature, humidity, vibration)
- Cybersecurity compliance framework (IEC 62443)
- Documentation package for regulatory submissions
- Quality management system (QMS) integration and procedures
- Risk assessment and mitigation documentation
- Compliance testing procedures and validation protocols
- Certification body coordination and submission management
- Audit trail and traceability systems for compliance verification
- Regulatory change management and update procedures

### EXACTLY What Will NOT Be Implemented

- FDA or pharmaceutical-specific regulations (not applicable)
- International shipping and customs compliance (logistics scope)
- Patent filing and intellectual property protection
- Environmental impact assessments beyond standard requirements
- Advanced cybersecurity penetration testing (security scope)

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Certification delays could impact product launch timeline
**Mitigation**: Early engagement with certification bodies and parallel testing processes

**Risk**: Non-compliance findings could require significant design changes
**Mitigation**: Continuous compliance assessment throughout development

**Risk**: Regulatory changes could invalidate existing certifications
**Mitigation**: Regulatory monitoring and change management procedures

**Risk**: Testing failures could require expensive re-testing and delays
**Mitigation**: Pre-compliance testing and design validation before formal testing

**Risk**: Documentation gaps could delay certification approval
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation review and validation processes
