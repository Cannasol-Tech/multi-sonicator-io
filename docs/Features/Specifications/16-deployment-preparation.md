# Feature Prompt: Deployment Preparation

## Purpose

Prepare the Multi Sonicator I/O Controller system for delivery by creating production firmware builds, documentation, configuration files, and troubleshooting tools.

---

### Implementation Steps

1. **Production Firmware Build**
   - Compile with `-O2` optimization, no debugging
   - Verify correct fuse bits and clock settings (e.g., external 16 MHz)
   - Use checksum or version tag in firmware header
   - Save as `build/sonicator_firmware_vX.Y.hex`

2. **Configuration Files**
   - Generate default configuration template for Slave ID, unit count
   - Store config options in EEPROM or header file
   - Include in delivery ZIP under `config/`

3. **Installation Guide**
   - Write `docs/installation.md`
   - Cover wiring diagram, DB9 pinout, power connection, and MODBUS parameters
   - Include screenshots of HMI and ladder logic examples

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Write `docs/troubleshooting.md`
   - List common symptoms and remedies (e.g., no response → check baud rate)
   - Include LED status decoding chart

5. **Packaging Deliverables**
   - `firmware/sonicator_firmware_vX.Y.hex`
   - `config/default_config.txt`
   - `docs/installation.md`
   - `docs/troubleshooting.md`
   - `docs/modbus_registers.md`
   - Test logs and validation report from Phase 8

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hex file is production-ready with version tag embedded
- [ ] Installation and troubleshooting docs are accurate and complete
- [ ] Config file enables field setup without recompilation
- [ ] Final ZIP includes all essential files for handoff
- [ ] Contents verified on clean test setup before delivery

---

### Dependencies

- Finalized firmware from phases 1–8
- Validation completed from `15-system-validation.md`

---

### Estimated Duration

6 hours

---

### Notes

Create and store backup of entire release package in versioned Git tag. Recommend archiving both raw and PDF versions of documents.

---

### Next Step

Once complete, mark `16-deployment-preparation.md` as ✅ and proceed to `17-documentation-finalization.md`
