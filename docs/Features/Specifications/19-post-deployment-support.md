# Feature Prompt: Post-Deployment Support

## Purpose

Establish procedures for monitoring, maintaining, and enhancing the Multi-Sonicator I/O Controller system after delivery. Provide mechanisms for field support, firmware updates, and feedback-based improvements.

---

### Implementation Steps

1. **Support Ticket Workflow**
   - Create `docs/support-log.md` for issue tracking
   - Define severity levels (Minor, Critical, Safety)
   - Log:
     - Timestamp
     - Affected unit/system
     - Reported symptom
     - Resolution or patch reference

2. **Remote Diagnostics and Monitoring**
   - If Firebase is active:
     - Periodically sync `uptime`, `alarms`, and performance stats
     - Notify support team if repeated overloads or emergency stops occur

3. **Firmware Update Process**
   - Deliver updates as `firmware/sonicator_firmware_vX.Y.hex`
   - Provide USB-ISP flashing instructions
   - Maintain changelog and backward compatibility notes
   - Consider bootloader support in future versions

4. **Enhancement Tracking**
   - Document requested improvements from customer or operator
   - Examples:
     - Multi-language support for HMI
     - Configurable ramp rate
     - Per-unit runtime log

5. **Patch Verification**
   - All patches must:
     - Be tested on simulated and physical units
     - Update validation logs
     - Retain MODBUS and timing compatibility

6. **Scheduled Maintenance**
   - Annual calibration check (if applicable)
   - EEPROM wear monitoring every 6 months
   - Inspect DB9 connectors and cable strain relief
