# Feature Prompt: Initial Project Setup

## Purpose

Establish the complete development environment and directory structure required for the Multi-Sonicator I/O Controller firmware and embedded systems development. This phase ensures the AVR microcontroller environment is ready and documented for sustainable development.

---

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize PlatformIO Project**
   - Target: `ATmega32A`
   - Framework: `Arduino`
   - Create initial `platformio.ini` configuration

2. **Directory Structure Setup**
   - `src/` for firmware source code
   - `include/` for headers and interfaces
   - `lib/` for modular reusable libraries
   - `test/` for unit tests (Google Test or Unity framework)
   - `docs/` for developer documentation

3. **AVR Toolchain Configuration**
   - Install AVR-GCC compiler, avrdude
   - Validate ISP programmer connectivity with test blink sketch

4. **Arduino Compatibility**
   - Configure `platformio.ini` to enable Arduino compatibility mode for easier prototyping

5. **Create Version Control Setup**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - `.gitignore` for PlatformIO, build artifacts, and secrets
   - Setup `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and branch naming conventions

6. **Agent Framework Bootstrapping**
   - Create a folder `agent/` for task automation logic (optional future expansion)

7. **Documentation Setup**
   - `docs/environment-setup.md` — all instructions for setting up AVR dev environment
   - `docs/architecture.md` — placeholder for future firmware module architecture

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project builds a basic test sketch without errors
- [ ] ISP programmer communication is validated
- [ ] Version control is initialized with correct file exclusions
- [ ] Documentation for setup is accessible and usable
- [ ] Directory structure matches PlatformIO and documentation best practices

### Dependencies

None

---

### Estimated Duration

2 hours

---

### Notes

This task must be completed before any hardware testing or firmware design begins. It establishes reproducibility and onboarding capability for future developers or agents.

---

### Next Step

Once complete, mark `1-initial-setup.md` as ✅ and proceed to `2-hardware-interface-implementation.md`
