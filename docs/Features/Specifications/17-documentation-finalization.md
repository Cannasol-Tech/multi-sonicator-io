# Feature Prompt: Documentation Finalization

## Purpose

Complete and polish all system documentation needed for installation, usage, support, maintenance, and compliance handoff. This ensures the Multi-Sonicator I/O Controller is fully supportable post-deployment.

---

### Implementation Steps

1. **Finalize API Documentation**
   - Ensure `docs/modbus_registers.md` is fully populated
   - Include:
     - Register address
     - Data type and scaling
     - Units
     - Access type (R/W, Read-only)
     - Description and example values

2. **Complete User Manual**
   - Create `docs/user-manual.md`
   - Topics:
     - System overview
     - Hardware connections
     - Normal operation and indicators
     - Alarm behaviors and reset steps
     - Maintenance guidelines (e.g., periodic inspection)

3. **Maintenance Procedures**
   - Include:
     - Firmware update steps via ISP
     - EEPROM clearing/reset
     - Debug port access locations
     - Long-term calibration recommendations (if applicable)

4. **Known Limitations**
   - Document any deferred features or edge case behaviors
   - Example:
     - "Frequency reading may be unstable <50Hz"
     - "EEPROM log stores last 32 events only"

5. **Training Materials**
   - Create onboarding slides or outline for operators and integrators
   - Include diagrams, screenshots, and checklists
   - Provide simplified startup and alarm response flows

6. **Internal Notes (Engineering)**
   - Store in `docs/internal_notes.md`
   - Notes for future development: diagnostic expansion, memory reuse, interrupt latency observations, hardware revisions

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All user-facing documentation is complete, clear, and version-stamped
- [ ] Maintenance and troubleshooting guides are usable by technician
- [ ] All limitations and workarounds are clearly disclosed
- [ ] Final documents archived in both markdown and PDF
- [ ] Git tag created for this documentation release

---

### Dependencies

- Deployment artifacts from `16-deployment-preparation.md`
- Completed validation from `15-system-validation.md`

---

### Estimated Duration

8 hours

---

### Notes

All documentation must pass a clarity review from a non-developer. Consider export to PDF and/or uploading to GitHub wiki for ease of access.

---

### Next Step

Once complete, mark `17-documentation-finalization.md` as âœ… and proceed to `18-installation-and-commissioning.md`
