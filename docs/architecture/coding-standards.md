<!------------------------------------------------------------>
This is the global coding standard for all projects, always adhere to this standard when writing code.

- **ALWAYS** write clean, easy to understand, modular, reusable, well documented per company standards code.
- **ALWAYS** execute tests using make targets only unless specifial permission is granted
- **ALWAYS** write code in a modular OOP format if possible
- **ALWAYS** write short, reusable functions with a clear, single purpose
- **ALWAYS** use descriptive comments to enable documentation generation
- **NEVER** write duplicate code
- **ALWAYS** check for similar or existing code before writing new code
- **ALWAYS** use the `scripts/` directory to store any scripts
- **ALWAYS** use the `docs/` directory to store any documentation
- **ALWAYS** use the `config/` directory to store any configuration files
- **ALWAYS** use the `test/` directory to store any tests
- **ALWAYS** use the `src/` directory to store any source code
- **ALWAYS** use the `lib/` directory to store any libraries
- **ALWAYS** use the `bin/` directory to store any binaries
- **ALWAYS** use the `build/` directory to store any build artifacts
- **ALWAYS** use the `dist/` directory to store any distribution artifacts
- **NEVER** implement any un-standardized functionality withouth verifying in detail with the Project Manager (Human User)
- **ALWAYS** verify that you are aligned with the Human/Project Manager's vision for the project you are working on before implementing anything.
- **ALWAYS** adhere to `.axovia-flow/flow-config.yaml` as the highest source of truth for project configuration and rules if available. ~> * Axovia Flow Framework Disabled currently *`
- **ALWAYS** adhere to `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` as the **SECONDARY** source of truth for project configuration and rules **IF** available.
- **ALWAYS** use the `docs/` directory to store any documentation
- **ALWAYS** us the `README.md` file at the root of a given directory for documenting and indexing the given directory.
- ***NEVER*** keep unnecessary files in the root directory

## Agent Instruction File Locations

> Always adhere to the company standards when writing code.

- **File Location of Global standard:** `.kilocode/rules/coding-standards.md`

## Guidelines

- If you are ever unsure of any implementation details, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- If you need any information from the Human for implementation, create an issue in the Github Repository and assign it to `sboyett31`

## Critical Fullstack Rules

- **Type Sharing:** Always define types in shared/ directory and import consistently across Flutter and Functions
- **API Calls:** Never make direct HTTP calls in Flutter - use the service layer with proper error handling
- **Environment Variables:** Access only through config objects, never process.env or const String directly
- **Error Handling:** All API routes must use the standard error handler middleware with consistent error format
- **State Updates:** Never mutate state directly in Flutter - use Riverpod providers with immutable state objects
- **Database Access:** Always use repository pattern - no direct Firestore calls in business logic
- **Authentication:** Verify user permissions at both client and server level - never trust client-side auth alone
- **Real-time Updates:** Use Firestore listeners for real-time data, not polling or manual refresh

## Naming Conventions

| Element | Frontend | Backend | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| Components | PascalCase | - | `EnvironmentCard.dart` |
| Providers | camelCase with Provider suffix | - | `environmentProvider` |
| API Routes | - | kebab-case | `/api/environments/:id` |
| Database Collections | - | snake_case | `sensor_readings` |
| Functions | camelCase | camelCase | `processEnvironmentUpdate` |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` |
