# Story 3.1 Validation Summary

- Template compliance: Pass (sections present, placeholders resolved)
- Status alignment: Updated to `Review`
- AC alignment: AC7 marked as `[Deferred]` and explicitly out of scope for S-3.1
- File paths: Valid; referenced source tree exists
- UI/Frontend scope: Complete and actionable
- Testing: Frameworks/locations defined; coverage target ≥85%
- Security: Auth/session deferred; note to revisit HTTPS/CSP when re-scoped

Final Assessment: Implementation-ready content, but acceptance is blocked by failing tests/coverage.

Implementation Readiness Score: 8/10
Confidence: Medium

Blocking Items:
- 179 failing tests (frontend) and coverage below 85%
- Ensure DoD/QA gates pass before completion

Actions Taken:
1) Fixed story status and AC7 scope
2) Generated PRD/Epics divergence note (see section below)
3) Ran DoD/QA gates (outputs appended)

## PRD vs Epics Divergence

- PRD `docs/prd/5-epic-list.md` names "Epic 3: HIL-Validation and Finalization"
- Repo epics define "Epic 3: Web UI Development" (`docs/agile/epics/epic-3-web-ui-development.md`)

Recommendation:
- Align PRD shard with repo epics by updating PRD section 5 or add an errata note linking Epic 3 Web UI Development.

## DoD/QA Gate Outputs

```
$ make validate-dod STORY=3.1
🔍 Validating Definition of Done compliance for Story 3.1...
📋 Checking DoD checklist completion...
📄 Using story file: docs/agile/stories/3.1.frontend-development-react-interface.md
❌ BLOCKING: DoD checklist section missing in docs/agile/stories/3.1.frontend-development-react-interface.md
📋 Required: Add DoD checklist using docs/sop/definition-of-done-template.md

$ make enforce-dod-gate STORY=3.1
🚫 ENFORCING DoD quality gate for Story 3.1...
⚠️  This is a MANDATORY quality gate - no bypassing allowed
❌ BLOCKING: DoD validation failed (see validate-dod output above)

$ make validate-story-completion STORY=3.1
🎯 Validating story completion readiness for Story 3.1...
❌ BLOCKING: DoD validation failed (see validate-dod output above)
```

## Notes

- When authentication returns to scope (future story), add explicit security testing items (HTTPS, CSP, input validation) and acceptance proofs.
