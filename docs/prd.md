# Sonicator Multiplexer Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1. Goals

* Increase throughput per PLC cell by at least 3x compared to the single-channel baseline.
* Reduce operator intervention time per batch by 50% or more.
* Decrease unplanned downtime from overload events by at least 30% through a standardized reset flow.
* Ensure the PLC receives per-unit telemetry at the required cadence with less than 1% packet loss.
* Enable the HMI to start, stop, or reset any connected sonicator unit within a 200ms command latency.
* Maintain amplitude control accuracy within Â±2% of the setpoint during steady-state operation.

### 1.2. Background Context

Currently, operations depend on manual or single-channel control of CT2000 sonicator units. This approach creates significant production bottlenecks, leads to inconsistent processing outcomes, and relies on fragmented, ad-hoc telemetry. The lack of a standardized, automated overload reset procedure further contributes to preventable downtime. These inefficiencies cap throughput, increase operator workload, and introduce quality assurance variability.

The proposed solution is a microcontroller-based multiplexer designed to manage up to four CT2000 units concurrently. It will expose a stable, well-defined MODBUS RTU interface for seamless integration with the primary PLC/HMI system. This system will provide granular, per-unit control (amplitude, start/stop, reset) and real-time monitoring (power, frequency, status), all validated through a comprehensive hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing framework to guarantee reliability before deployment.

8. **FR8**: The system shall expose all control and monitoring capabilities through a MODBUS RTU slave interface.
9. **FR9**: The system shall report the total number of currently active sonicators and a bitmask representing their individual running states.
10. **FR10**: On power-up, all sonicator units shall default to an 'off' state and require an explicit 'start' command to begin operation.
11. **FR11**: If communication with the master PLC/HMI is lost for more than one second, all sonicator units shall automatically enter a safe, non-operational state.
12. **FR12**: The system shall provide a `CONNECTED_SONICATORS_COUNT` MODBUS register that automatically detects and reports the number of physically connected and responsive sonicator units (0-4) by polling for signals from each sonicator module.

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1**: The end-to-end latency for any command (e.g., start, stop, reset) shall not exceed 200ms.
2. **NFR2**: Any change in a sonicator's state must be reflected in its corresponding MODBUS register within 100ms.
3. **NFR3**: The firmware must be implemented in C with a modular architecture that separates hardware abstraction, communication protocols, and control logic.
4. **NFR4**: All public functions and data structures in header files must be documented using Doxygen-style comments.
5. **NFR5**: The system must implement a watchdog timer to ensure it resets to a safe, non-operational state in the event of a software failure.
6. **NFR6**: The project must achieve a minimum of 90% unit test coverage using Unity Test Framework.
7. **NFR7**: All functional requirements must be verifiable through automated acceptance tests (simulation and/or Hardware-in-the-Loop).
8. **NFR8**: The MODBUS RTU communication must operate at 115200 baud with an 8N1 frame format.
9. **NFR9**: Telemetry data (power, frequency) for each unit shall be updated in the MODBUS registers at a minimum frequency of 10Hz.
10. **NFR10**: The system shall provide a non-volatile flag or dedicated register to indicate if the last system reset was caused by the watchdog timer.
11. **NFR11**: Firmware updates will be performed via a physical ISP header; no over-the-air update mechanism is required for the MVP.

## 7. Timeline and Milestones

This project is divided into three main epics, each concluding with a significant milestone.

* **Epic 1: Foundational Control & Communication (Estimated Duration: 2 Weeks)**
  * **Milestone:** A single sonicator can be fully controlled and monitored via the MODBUS interface. The core firmware architecture and CI/CD pipeline are operational.

* **Epic 2: Multi-Sonicator Management & Safety Features (Estimated Duration: 2 Weeks)**
  * **Milestone:** The system can reliably control and monitor all four sonicators concurrently. All safety features (overload reset, watchdog, failsafe) are implemented and pass initial tests.

* **Epic 3: HIL-Validation and Finalization (Estimated Duration: 1 Week)**
  * **Milestone:** The firmware is fully validated on physical hardware, meets all performance and reliability requirements, and is ready for deployment. All documentation and test coverage targets are met.

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

* **Risk:** Hardware integration with the CT2000 units reveals unexpected behavior not covered in the datasheet.
  * **Mitigation:** Allocate buffer time in the schedule for an initial hardware discovery phase. Develop a flexible hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to quickly adapt to minor hardware variations.

* **Risk:** MODBUS RTU implementation proves to be unreliable under heavy load or in noisy electrical environments.
  * **Mitigation:** Implement robust error checking (CRC) and a retry mechanism in the communication protocol. Conduct extensive HIL testing under simulated high-load and noisy conditions.

* **Risk:** The ATmega32A microcontroller lacks the processing power to handle four sonicators at the required 10Hz telemetry update rate while managing the communication stack.
  * **Mitigation:** Profile the application early and continuously. Optimize critical code paths. If performance is still an issue, evaluate reducing telemetry frequency as a trade-off with the stakeholder.

* **Risk:** Delays in receiving the physical hardware for HIL testing could impact the project timeline.
  * **Mitigation:** Rely heavily on the simulation environment for initial development and validation. Maintain open communication with the hardware team to get the earliest possible access to a prototype.
