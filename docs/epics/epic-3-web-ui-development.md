# Epic 3: Web UI Development

**Epic ID**: E-3  
**Priority**: Medium-High  
**Owner**: UX Lead  
**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Updated**: 2025-01-09  

## Status

InProgress

## Epic Summary

Develop a modern web-based user interface for sonicator control and monitoring, providing operators with intuitive access to all system functions through a responsive browser-based application.

## Scope Definition

### EXACTLY What Will Be Implemented

- React-based frontend with responsive design
- Node.js backend API for hardware communication
- Real-time WebSocket communication for live monitoring
- Interactive hardware diagram with visual pin state representation
- Sonicator control interface (start/stop/amplitude adjustment)
- System status monitoring and alerting
- User authentication and session management
- Mobile-responsive design for tablet/phone access

### EXACTLY What Will NOT Be Implemented

- Advanced analytics dashboard (future epic)
- Multi-user role management (basic auth only)
- Historical data visualization beyond basic logging
- Third-party system integrations
- Offline mode capabilities

## Business Value

**Primary Value**: Enables remote sonicator operation and monitoring
**Secondary Value**: Reduces training requirements with intuitive interface
**Risk Mitigation**: Provides backup control method independent of MODBUS master

## User Stories

1. **Story 3.0**: Web UI Integration - Arduino test harness web interface
2. **Story 3.1**: Frontend Development - React-based user interface
3. **Story 3.2**: Backend API - Node.js server for hardware communication
4. **Story 3.3**: Real-time Monitoring - WebSocket-based live updates
5. **Story 3.4**: Mobile Responsiveness - Tablet and phone compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **User Interface**: Intuitive control interface accessible via web browser
2. **Real-time Updates**: Live hardware status updates within 1 second
3. **Mobile Support**: Fully functional on tablets and smartphones
4. **Authentication**: Secure login with session management
5. **Hardware Control**: All sonicator functions accessible through UI
6. **Status Monitoring**: Clear indication of system health and alerts
7. **Performance**: Page load times <3 seconds, UI responsiveness <500ms

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- Epic 1: Foundational Control & Communication (MODBUS interface)
- Epic 2: Testing Infrastructure (for UI testing)
- Hardware abstraction layer operational

### Enables

- Epic 4: Production Deployment (complete system ready)
- Future analytics and reporting features

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Browser compatibility issues across different devices
**Mitigation**: Progressive web app approach with fallback support

**Risk**: Real-time communication reliability
**Mitigation**: WebSocket with automatic reconnection and fallback polling

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in web interface
**Mitigation**: Security review, HTTPS enforcement, input validation
