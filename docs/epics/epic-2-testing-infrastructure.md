# Epic 2: Testing Infrastructure

**Epic ID**: E-2  
**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: QA Lead  
**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Updated**: 2025-01-09  

## Status

Ready for Planning

## Epic Summary

Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing frameworks to ensure product robustness and traceability across all development phases.

## Scope Definition

### EXACTLY What Will Be Implemented

- Comprehensive unit testing framework with ≥90% coverage requirement
- Integration testing for hardware-software interfaces
- Acceptance testing with BDD scenarios
- Test automation and CI/CD pipeline integration
- Test reporting and traceability documentation
- Performance testing for MODBUS communication timing
- Hardware simulation capabilities for testing without physical devices

### EXACTLY What Will NOT Be Implemented

- Load testing for production scale (future epic)
- Security penetration testing
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - handled by business stakeholders
- Third-party integration testing beyond MODBUS

## Business Value

**Primary Value**: Ensures product reliability and reduces defect escape rate
**Secondary Value**: Enables confident refactoring and feature additions
**Risk Mitigation**: Catches integration issues early in development cycle

## User Stories

1. **Story 2.0**: Testing Framework Setup - Multi-level testing infrastructure
2. **Story 2.1**: Unit Test Coverage - Comprehensive unit testing with coverage metrics
3. **Story 2.2**: Integration Test Suite - Hardware-software integration validation
4. **Story 2.3**: Performance Testing - MODBUS timing and throughput validation
5. **Story 2.4**: Test Automation - CI/CD pipeline integration

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Coverage Metrics**: ≥90% unit test coverage maintained
2. **Test Automation**: All tests run automatically on code changes
3. **Integration Testing**: Hardware interfaces validated with real and simulated devices
4. **Performance Validation**: MODBUS response times <100ms consistently
5. **Traceability**: All requirements traced to test cases
6. **Reporting**: Automated test reports generated for each build
7. **Documentation**: Test strategy and procedures documented

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Epic 1: Foundational Control & Communication (completed)
- HIL testing framework operational
- MODBUS communication interface functional

### Enables
- Epic 3: Web UI Development (with confidence in backend stability)
- Epic 4: Production Deployment (with validated quality gates)

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Test execution time may slow development velocity
**Mitigation**: Parallel test execution and selective test running

**Risk**: Hardware dependency may make tests unreliable
**Mitigation**: Simulation capabilities and hardware abstraction

**Risk**: Test maintenance overhead
**Mitigation**: Focus on high-value tests, regular test review cycles

## Definition of Done
