# Axovia AI Flow - Publishing SOP (Node Packages)

This document describes standard operating procedures for publishing Node packages at Axovia AI.

Applies to: @axovia/agile-flow and similar CLI-oriented packages.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- NPM 8+
- Authenticated to the private npm registry/scope (@axovia)
- Python 3.9+ available for packages that wrap Python CLIs

## Versioning
- Use Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Bump version in package.json
- Changelog entry for each release

## CLI-only Publishing (Manual)
1. Clean and build (if applicable)
   - `npm ci`
   - `npm run test`
2. Smoke test locally
   - `node bin/agile-flow.js --help`
3. Bump version in package.json
4. Publish (scoped, restricted)
   - `npm publish --access restricted`
5. Tag and push
   - `git tag v<version>`
   - `git push origin --tags`

## CI-driven Publishing
Trigger: tagged release (vX.Y.Z) on main

- CI validates: lint, tests, packaging
- If all green, CI publishes to npm with restricted access using an NPM_TOKEN with publish rights

Example GitHub Actions steps:
- checkout
- setup-node (Node 18)
- npm ci
- npm test
- npm publish --provenance --access restricted

## Rollback Procedure
- Deprecate the faulty version: `npm deprecate @axovia/agile-flow@X.Y.Z "reason"`
- Publish a hotfix version: bump PATCH and publish

## Security and Access
- Use least-privileged npm tokens
- Rotate tokens every 90 days
- Keep publish rights limited to release engineers or CI only

## Notes
- This package is CLI-only for now. TypeScript types are provided as placeholders.
- Ensure README examples use the scoped package name: `npx @axovia/agile-flow`

# Node.js Package Publishing Standard

**Document Type**: Company Standard  
**Scope**: All Axovia AI Node.js packages and libraries  
**Status**: Active  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Author**: Stephen Boyett  
**Company**: Axovia AI  

## Purpose

This document establishes the **SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for Node.js package publishing standards across all Axovia AI projects. It defines requirements, processes, and quality gates for publishing packages to public and private registries.

## Scope and Authority

### Applicability

- **ALL** Node.js packages intended for distribution
- **ALL** CLI tools and utilities built with Node.js
- **ALL** libraries and frameworks for internal or external use
- **ALL** npm packages published to public or private registries

### Compliance Requirement

- **MANDATORY**: All packages MUST follow these standards before publishing
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Deviations require written CTO approval
- **ENFORCEMENT**: All packages must pass quality gates before publication

## Core Publishing Principles

### 1. Quality First

**Requirement**: No package may be published without comprehensive testing and validation.

**Implementation Standards**:

- 100% test coverage for public APIs
- All tests must pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Security vulnerability scanning completed
- Performance benchmarks established

### 2. Semantic Versioning

**Requirement**: All packages MUST follow semantic versioning (semver) strictly.

**Implementation Standards**:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require user code updates
- **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes that are backward compatible
- **Pre-release**: Use alpha, beta, rc suffixes for pre-release versions

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

**Requirement**: All packages must have complete, accurate documentation.

**Implementation Standards**:

- README.md with installation, usage, and examples
- API documentation for all public interfaces
- CHANGELOG.md with detailed version history
- Contributing guidelines and code of conduct

### 4. Security and Compliance

**Requirement**: All packages must meet security and compliance standards.

**Implementation Standards**:

- No secrets or credentials in package contents
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance verification
- Privacy and data protection compliance

## Package Structure Requirements

### Mandatory Files

Every publishable package MUST include:

```md
package.json          # Package metadata and dependencies
README.md            # Comprehensive documentation

CHANGELOG.md         # Version history and changes
.npmignore          # Files to exclude from package
```

### Recommended Files

```md
CONTRIBUTING.md      # Contribution guidelines

## Publishing Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Publication Validation (MANDATORY)

**Quality Gates Checklist**:

- [ ] All tests pass with 100% coverage for public APIs
- [ ] Security vulnerability scan completed (0 high/critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Documentation review completed and approved
- [ ] License compliance verified
- [ ] Version number follows semantic versioning
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with all changes
- [ ] Package size optimized (< 10MB for most packages)
- [ ] Dependencies audited and minimized

**Validation Commands**:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Security audit
npm audit --audit-level high

# Package size check
npm pack --dry-run

# Lint package.json
npm run lint:package

# Validate documentation
npm run docs:validate
```

### Phase 2: Registry Selection

**Public NPM Registry** (for open source packages):

```bash
# Verify registry
npm config get registry

# Should return: https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

**GitHub Packages** (for organization packages):

```bash
# Configure registry for scoped packages
npm config set @axovia-ai:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

**Private Registry** (for internal packages):

```bash
# Configure private registry
npm config set registry https://your-private-registry.com
```

### Phase 3: Publication Execution

**Pre-Publication Steps**:

```bash
# Clean build
npm run clean
npm run build

# Final test run
npm test

# Version bump (if needed)
npm version patch|minor|major

# Create git tag
git tag v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
```

**Publication Commands**:

```bash
# Dry run first
npm publish --dry-run

# Publish to public registry
npm publish

# Publish to GitHub Packages
npm publish --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com

# Publish with specific tag
npm publish --tag beta
```

**Post-Publication Steps**:

```bash
# Push tags to repository
git push origin --tags

# Create GitHub release
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "Release v1.0.0" --notes-file CHANGELOG.md

# Update documentation
npm run docs:deploy
```
