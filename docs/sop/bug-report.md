<!-- -- Agile Flow™ Agentic Framework Bug Report Standard -->

# Overview

## Describe the bug
The live Monitoring display is showing a GREEN status when the hardware is not correctly configured. The system should indicate an error state or warning when hardware configuration issues are present.

## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Start the system with incorrect hardware configuration
2. Navigate to the live Monitoring display
3. Observe the status indicator
4. See GREEN status despite hardware configuration issues

## Expected behavior
The live Monitoring display should show an appropriate error state (RED) or warning state (YELLOW) when hardware is not correctly configured, not GREEN which indicates normal operation. 

**Expected behavior**
The live Monitoring display should show an appropriate error state (RED) or warning state (YELLOW) when hardware is not correctly configured, not GREEN which indicates normal operation.

**Hardware Configuration**
- Controller Version: [e.g., v1.0.0]
- Sonicator Model: [e.g., CT2000]
- Number of Sonicators: [e.g., 4]
- MODBUS Configuration: [e.g., Slave ID 2, 115200 baud]

**Error Information**
- Error Code: [if displayed]
- LED Status: GREEN (incorrect)
- Serial Output: [if available]

**Screenshots/Logs**
See reference image: `.github/issues_to_create/resource/issue_001_image_01.png` for example of the issue.

**Additional context**
The monitoring display should reflect the actual hardware state and configuration status, not default to GREEN when there are underlying configuration problems.

**Testing Environment**
- [x] Physical Hardware
- [ ] Simulation
- [ ] Both

**Severity**
- [ ] Critical (System unusable)
- [x] High (Major feature broken)
- [ ] Medium (Minor feature issue)
- [ ] Low (Cosmetic issue)

**Safety Impact**
- [x] Safety-critical issue
- [ ] Non-safety-critical issue
- [ ] Unknown
