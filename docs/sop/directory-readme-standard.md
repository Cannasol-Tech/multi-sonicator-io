# Axovia AI Company Standard: Directory README Files

## Purpose

This standard defines the required structure and content for `README.md` files placed in project directories. Consistent directory READMEs improve navigability, enable automated indexing by AI agents, and drive quality gates for documentation completeness.

## Scope

- Applies to any directory intended to be consumed by developers or agents.
- Particularly recommended for: `tests/`, `docs/`, `src/` subtrees, and `config/`.

## Required Structure

Each directory `README.md` MUST include the following sections in order:

1. Frontmatter Header (YAML-like) with metadata
2. Provenance banner (Agile Flow generated line)
3. Critical rules or usage guidance (optional but encouraged)
4. Overview/Context for the directory
5. Directory structure block (fenced code block)
6. Commands/Targets relevant to the directory
7. Links and traceability to standards/specs

## 1) Frontmatter Header

- MUST follow the structure below.
- Keys may be extended, but required keys must exist.

```yaml

# Generated by Agile Flow™ Agentic Framework
file: <relative_path_to_this_readme>
title: <directory_title>
author: <maintainer_or_author>

      options:
        - --flag <value>

    description: <target_description>
    options:
      - --flag <value>
tags:
  - <tag1>
  - <tag2>
---
```

## 2) Provenance Banner

- Immediately after the frontmatter, add a line:

```html
<!-- Generated by Agile Flow™ Agentic Framework  -->
```

## 3) Critical Rules or Usage Guidance

- Use an emphasized block that highlights critical rules for this directory.
- Example for acceptance tests:

```text
> <------------------------------------------------------->
> ***!!! CRITICAL AGENT RULES FOR ACCEPTANCE TESTING !!!***
> <------------------------------------------------------->
```

## 4) Overview/Context

- Provide concise bullets describing what lives in the directory and how it is used.
- Prefer consistent phrasing like “The `X` are located in …”.

## 5) Directory Structure

- Use fenced code block (no inline HTML) with language hint `text`.
- Show representative tree, not exhaustive listing.

## 6) Commands/Targets

- Provide a fenced block (yml) that lists Makefile or CLI targets and their options.
- Keep this in sync with actual Makefile or flows.

## 7) Links and Traceability

- Link to relevant standards, specs, and flows. Examples:
  - `docs/sop/sw-testing.md`
  - `docs/sop/makefile-standard.md`
  - `.agile-flow/flows/<flow>.yaml`

## Quality Requirements

- MUST avoid inline HTML (markdownlint MD033).
- MUST include date and version.
- SHOULD include at least one `commands` entry for discoverability.
- SHOULD include tags for AI indexing (e.g., `qa`, `bdd`, `orchestration`).

## Example

A full example is provided in `tests/acceptance/README.md`. This standard closely mirrors that format while keeping it generic for all directories.

## Maintenance

- Update the `version` field when making substantial format changes.
- The standard is enforced during reviews and can be validated by agents.
