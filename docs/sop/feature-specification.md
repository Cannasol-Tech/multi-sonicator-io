# Feature Specification Standard

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Company**: Axovia AI
**Author**: Stephen Boyett  
**Status**: Company Single Source of Truth Standard Operating Procedure for Feature Specifications  

## Overview

Feature Specifications define the **EXACT** functionality to be implemented by development teams. They serve as the definitive contract between Product and Development, specifying precisely what will be built - no more, no less.

## Core Principles

### 1. **EXACT SCOPE DEFINITION**

- Feature Specifications define **EXACTLY** what functionality will be implemented
- **NO MORE**: Developers should not implement functionality beyond what is specified
- **NO LESS**: All specified functionality must be implemented for feature completion
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: If functionality is not explicitly specified, it should not be implemented

### 2. **LARGER THAN USER STORIES**

- Features encompass multiple related user stories
- Features represent cohesive functional areas
- Features deliver complete user value independently

### 3. **COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION**

- Every behavior must be explicitly defined
- Every interaction must be specified
- Every edge case must be addressed
- Every error condition must be handled

## Feature Specification Template

### File Naming Convention

```sh
docs/agile/features/feature-{ID}-{name-kebab-case}.md
```

### Template Structure

```markdown
# Feature {ID}: {Feature Name}

**Feature ID**: F-{XXX}  
**Status**: [Draft | Approved | In Development | Complete]  
**Priority**: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]  
**Epic**: Epic {N}: {Epic Name}  
**Owner**: {Product Owner}  
**Created**: {YYYY-MM-DD}  
**Updated**: {YYYY-MM-DD}  

## Feature Summary

{1-2 sentences describing exactly what this feature does}

## Scope Definition

### EXACTLY What Will Be Implemented
{Precise list of functionality that WILL be implemented}

### EXACTLY What Will NOT Be Implemented
{Explicit list of related functionality that will NOT be included}

### Scope Boundaries
{Clear boundaries of where this feature starts and stops}

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
{Detailed, step-by-step description of exactly how the feature works}

### User Interactions
{Every user interaction explicitly defined with expected system responses}

### System Behaviors
{Every system behavior explicitly specified}

### Data Handling
{Exact data processing, storage, and retrieval requirements}

### Integration Points
{Precise integration requirements with other system components}

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria
1. {Specific, measurable, testable requirement}
2. {Additional specific requirement}
3. {Continue for all requirements}

### Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: {Exact input specifications}
- **Processing**: {Exact processing requirements}
- **Output**: {Exact output specifications}

### Error Handling Requirements
1. {Specific error condition} → {Exact system response}
2. {Additional error condition} → {Exact system response}

### Performance Requirements
- {Specific performance criteria with measurable thresholds}
- {Response time requirements}
- {Throughput requirements}

### Validation Rules
- {Exact validation rules for all inputs}
- {Data integrity requirements}
- {Business rule enforcement}

## Implementation Constraints

### Technical Constraints
{Specific technical limitations and requirements}

### Business Rules
{Exact business rules that must be enforced}

### Dependencies
- **Required Before**: {Features/components that must exist first}
- **Required During**: {Features/components needed during implementation}
- **Impacts**: {Features/components this will affect}

## Definition of Done

### Feature Completion Criteria
- [ ] All specified functionality implemented exactly as defined
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met with evidence
- [ ] All error conditions handled as specified
- [ ] All performance requirements met
- [ ] All validation rules implemented

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: {Specific review criteria}
- **Testing**: {Required test coverage and types}
- **Performance**: {Performance validation requirements}
- **Security**: {Security validation if applicable}

## Testing Requirements

### Required Test Coverage
{Exact testing requirements for this feature}

### Test Scenarios
1. {Specific test scenario with expected results}
2. {Additional test scenario with expected results}

### Edge Case Testing
{All edge cases that must be tested}

### Error Condition Testing
{All error conditions that must be tested}

## Implementation Mapping

### Related PRD Requirements
- **{Requirement ID}**: {Requirement description}

### Implementing User Stories
- **Story {Epic}.{Story}**: {Story title}
- **Story {Epic}.{Story}**: {Additional stories}

### Quality Assurance
{QA requirements specific to this feature}

## Change Control

### Scope Changes
{Process for handling scope changes during development}

### Approval Requirements
{Who must approve changes to this specification}

## Success Metrics

### Completion Metrics
{How feature completion will be measured}

### Success Criteria
{Definition of successful feature delivery}

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Change | Author |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| {YYYY-MM-DD} | 1.0 | Initial specification | {Author} |
```

## Standard Requirements

### MANDATORY Sections

Every Feature Specification MUST include:

- **Scope Definition** (What WILL and WILL NOT be implemented)
- **Functional Requirements** (Exact functionality specification)
- **Acceptance Criteria** (Measurable completion criteria)
- **Definition of Done** (Exact completion requirements)
- **Implementation Mapping** (Traceability to stories)

### Specification Quality Standards

#### Exactness Requirements

- **Precise Language**: Use specific, unambiguous language
- **Complete Coverage**: Address all functionality aspects
- **Measurable Criteria**: All acceptance criteria must be testable
- **No Ambiguity**: Eliminate interpretation gaps

#### Scope Control Requirements

- **Explicit Inclusions**: List exactly what will be implemented
- **Explicit Exclusions**: List what will NOT be implemented
- **Clear Boundaries**: Define feature start/stop points
- **No Assumptions**: Specify all expected behaviors

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create Feature Specifications

- For functionality spanning multiple user stories
- For complex features requiring precise definition
- For features with significant business impact
- For features requiring exact scope control

### Development Team Responsibilities

- **Implement EXACTLY** what is specified
- **Question ambiguities** before implementation
- **Request clarification** for undefined behaviors
- **Do NOT implement** unspecified functionality
- **Do NOT assume** requirements not explicitly stated

### Product Owner Responsibilities

- **Define EXACTLY** what should be implemented
- **Specify ALL** required behaviors
- **Address ALL** edge cases and error conditions
- **Approve ALL** scope changes explicitly
- **Review implementation** against specification

## Quality Assurance

### Specification Review Process

1. **Completeness Check**: All required sections present
2. **Exactness Review**: All functionality precisely defined
3. **Scope Validation**: Clear boundaries established
4. **Testability Review**: All criteria measurable
5. **Stakeholder Approval**: All stakeholders sign-off

### Implementation Validation

- Development must match specification exactly
- No additional functionality without specification update
- All acceptance criteria must be demonstrably met
- Quality gates must validate against specification

---

**CRITICAL RULE**: If functionality is not explicitly specified in the Feature Specification, it should NOT be implemented. When in doubt, ask for specification clarification rather than making assumptions.

**Compliance**: This standard is mandatory for all feature development. Deviations require explicit Product Owner approval and specification updates.
