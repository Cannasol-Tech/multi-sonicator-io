# Multi-Agent Collaboration Standard

**Document Type**: Company Standard  
**Scope**: All Cannasol Technologies, Axovia AI, Silverline Software, and True Tune projects  
**Status**: Inactive  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Effective Date**: 2025-09-12
**Author**: Stephen Boyett  
**Company**: Axovia AI  

## Purpose

This document establishes the **SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for multi-agent collaboration standards across all company projects. It defines protocols, patterns, and requirements for coordinating multiple specialized AI agents in software development workflows.

## Scope and Authority

### Applicability

- **ALL** projects using multiple AI agents for development workflows
- **ALL** AI-driven document generation and review processes  
- **ALL** automated quality assurance and testing workflows
- **ALL** project management and coordination activities involving AI agents

### Compliance Requirement

- **MANDATORY**: All company projects MUST follow these standards
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Deviations require written CTO approval
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Project reviews will validate compliance

## Core Collaboration Principles

### 1. Deterministic Agent Handoffs

**Requirement**: Agent transitions must be predictable, repeatable, and auditable.

**Implementation Standards**:

- Explicit handoff protocols with defined inputs/outputs
- Validation gates at every agent transition
- Rollback capability for failed handoffs
- Complete audit trail of all transitions

### 2. Centralized State Management

**Requirement**: All agents operate on consistent, synchronized state.

**Implementation Standards**:

- Single source of truth for workflow state
- ACID-compliant state operations
- Atomic state transitions with rollback capability
- Real-time state synchronization across all agents

### 3. Role-Based Agent Specialization

**Requirement**: Each agent has clearly defined, non-overlapping responsibilities.

**Implementation Standards**:

- Formal agent registry with capability definitions
- Tool and permission restrictions per agent role
- Validation that agents stay within defined scope
- Clear escalation paths for capability gaps

### 4. Fault-Tolerant Operations

**Requirement**: System continues operation despite individual agent failures.

**Implementation Standards**:

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker patterns for persistent failures
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Human escalation for unrecoverable errors

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Workflow

```yaml
Type: Linear agent chain
Pattern: PM → Architect → Developer → QA
Synchronization: Blocking handoffs with validation
Use Case: Standard development workflows
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Processing

```yaml
Type: Concurrent agent execution
Pattern: Coordinator → [Agent A, Agent B, Agent C] → Merger
Synchronization: Barrier synchronization at merge points
Use Case: Independent work streams
```

### Pattern 3: Review and Revision

```yaml
Type: Iterative improvement cycle
Pattern: Creator → Reviewer → Creator (repeat until approved)
Synchronization: Approval-based progression
Use Case: Document review and quality assurance
```

### Pattern 4: Producer-Consumer

```yaml
Type: Continuous processing pipeline
Pattern: Producer → Queue → Consumer(s)
Synchronization: Message acknowledgment
Use Case: CI/CD and automated testing
```

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### 1. Agent Registry Standard

**Required Agent Definition**:

```yaml
agent:
  id: "unique_identifier"
  role: "pm|architect|dev|qa|analyst|ux"
  model: "claude-3.5-sonnet|gpt-4|gemini-pro"
  version: "semantic_version"
  capabilities:
    - "capability_1"
    - "capability_2"
  tools:
    - "tool_1" 
    - "tool_2"
  constraints:
    max_concurrent_workflows: integer
    timeout_minutes: integer
    retry_attempts: integer
  context_requirements:
    - "required_file_path_1"
    - "required_file_path_2"
  output_schemas:
    - "schema_file_1.json"
    - "schema_file_2.json"
```

### 2. State Management Standard

**Required State Store**:

- **Development**: SQLite with ACID transactions
- **Production**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Schema**: Versioned with automated migrations
- **Backup**: Automated with point-in-time recovery

**State Update Protocol**:

```python
# MANDATORY state update pattern
def update_workflow_state(workflow_id, agent_id, new_state):
    with atomic_transaction():
        validate_agent_permissions(agent_id, workflow_id)
        current_state = get_current_state(workflow_id)
        validate_state_transition(current_state, new_state)
        validate_output_schema(new_state)
        persist_state_change(workflow_id, new_state)
        log_state_transition(workflow_id, agent_id, current_state, new_state)
        notify_dependent_agents(workflow_id, new_state)
```

### 3. Message Passing Standard

**Required Message Format**:

```json
{
  "message_id": "uuid_v4",
  "workflow_id": "uuid_v4",
  "timestamp": "iso8601_utc",
  "from_agent": "agent_role",
  "to_agent": "agent_role", 
  "message_type": "handoff|notification|request|response|error",
  "priority": "critical|high|normal|low",
  "payload": {
    "artifacts": ["file_paths"],
    "context": "workflow_context",
    "requirements": "acceptance_criteria",
    "validation_results": "schema_validation_output"
  },
  "retry_count": 0,
  "expires_at": "iso8601_utc"
}
```

**Message Delivery Requirements**:

- **Guarantee**: At-least-once delivery with idempotency
- **Ordering**: FIFO within workflow context
- **Persistence**: Messages stored until acknowledged
- **Timeout**: Configurable with automatic retry

### 4. Handoff Protocol Standard

**Pre-Handoff Validation (MANDATORY)**:

1. **Artifact Completeness**: All required outputs present
2. **Schema Validation**: Outputs validate against JSON schemas
3. **Quality Gates**: Automated quality checks pass
4. **Dependency Check**: All prerequisites satisfied

**Handoff Execution (MANDATORY)**:

1. **Atomic State Update**: Workflow state updated in single transaction
2. **Artifact Transfer**: Files moved to receiving agent context

1. **Receipt Acknowledgment**: Receiving agent confirms handoff
2. **Context Validation**: Agent has all required context
3. **Capability Verification**: Agent can perform required tasks

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Classification Standard

- **Transient**: Network timeouts, temporary resource unavailability

- **System**: Infrastructure failures, service outages
- **Logic**: Workflow definition errors, configuration problems

### Recovery Strategy Requirements

```python
# MANDATORY error handling pattern
def handle_agent_error(error_type, context, attempt_count):
    if error_type == "transient" and attempt_count < MAX_RETRIES:
        return exponential_backoff_retry(context, attempt_count)
    elif error_type == "permanent":
        return escalate_to_human_review(context)
    elif error_type == "system":
        return activate_failover_procedures(context)
    elif error_type == "logic":
        return halt_workflow_and_alert(context)
    else:
        return escalate_to_engineering_team(context)
