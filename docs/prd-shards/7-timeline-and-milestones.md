# 7. Timeline and Milestones

This project is divided into three main epics, each concluding with a significant milestone.

* **Epic 1: Foundational Control & Communication (Estimated Duration: 2 Weeks)**
  * **Milestone:** A single sonicator can be fully controlled and monitored via the MODBUS interface. The core firmware architecture and CI/CD pipeline are operational.

* **Epic 2: Multi-Sonicator Management & Safety Features (Estimated Duration: 2 Weeks)**
  * **Milestone:** The system can reliably control and monitor all four sonicators concurrently. All safety features (overload reset, watchdog, failsafe) are implemented and pass initial tests.

* **Epic 3: HIL-Validation and Finalization (Estimated Duration: 1 Week)**
  * **Milestone:** The firmware is fully validated on physical hardware, meets all performance and reliability requirements, and is ready for deployment. All documentation and test coverage targets are met.
