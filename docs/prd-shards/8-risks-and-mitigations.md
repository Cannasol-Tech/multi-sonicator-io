# 8. Risks and Mitigations

* **Risk:** Hardware integration with the CT2000 units reveals unexpected behavior not covered in the datasheet.
  * **Mitigation:** Allocate buffer time in the schedule for an initial hardware discovery phase. Develop a flexible hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to quickly adapt to minor hardware variations.

* **Risk:** MODBUS RTU implementation proves to be unreliable under heavy load or in noisy electrical environments.
  * **Mitigation:** Implement robust error checking (CRC) and a retry mechanism in the communication protocol. Conduct extensive HIL testing under simulated high-load and noisy conditions.

* **Risk:** The ATmega32A microcontroller lacks the processing power to handle four sonicators at the required 10Hz telemetry update rate while managing the communication stack.
  * **Mitigation:** Profile the application early and continuously. Optimize critical code paths. If performance is still an issue, evaluate reducing telemetry frequency as a trade-off with the stakeholder.

* **Risk:** Delays in receiving the physical hardware for HIL testing could impact the project timeline.
  * **Mitigation:** Rely heavily on the simulation environment for initial development and validation. Maintain open communication with the hardware team to get the earliest possible access to a prototype.
