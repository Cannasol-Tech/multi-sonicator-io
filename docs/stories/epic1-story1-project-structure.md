## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**

- Epic 1 Story 0: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification completed
- Hardware setup (ATmega32A board, Arduino as ISP)
- PlatformIO installed and configured
- Arduino as ISP programmer setup

**Enables Next Stories:**

- Hardware Abstraction Layer implementation

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Arduino as ISP programming setup complexity
**Mitigation:** Step-by-step documentation and verification
**Verification:** Successful upload and basic functionality test

## Notes

- This story establishes the foundation for all subsequent development
- Focus on simplicity and standards compliance
- All pin assignments must follow docs/planning/pin-matrix.md (SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- Status LED implementation must use PD2 (physical pin 16) per architecture document
