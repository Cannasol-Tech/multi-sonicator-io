# Story 0.9: Test Coverage & Documentation

**Story ID**: S-0.9
**Epic**: Epic 0: HIL Testing Framework & Hardware Verification
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Product Owner
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Updated**: 2025-09-10

## Status

NotStarted

## User Story

As a product owner and QA lead,
I want ≥85% unit test coverage and complete Doxygen documentation,
so that quality gates are satisfied and the system is maintainable.

## Scope

- Raise overall unit test statement coverage to ≥85%
- Ensure acceptance tests run on physical hardware pass reliably
- Generate complete Doxygen documentation and review for accuracy
- Produce test and documentation reports per company standards

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit test coverage ≥85% (statement) with report artifacts
2. All acceptance BDD tests pass on hardware at least once consecutively
3. Doxygen documentation generated without warnings and reviewed
4. Reports adhere to `docs/standards/sw-testing-standard.md` and `docs/standards/release-report.md`
5. Regression log policy followed for any failures (`REGRESSION-ISSUES.md` if needed)

## Tasks

- [ ] Add/expand unit tests to reach ≥85% coverage; commit reports
- [ ] Execute `make test-acceptance` with hardware attached; collect logs
- [ ] Fix failing tests or document regressions with root-cause analysis
- [ ] Configure and run Doxygen; resolve warnings; publish artifacts
- [ ] Update testing and documentation sections in README as needed

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Coverage report shows ≥85% and is stored in CI artifact
- [ ] Acceptance tests pass and logs are archived under `test/acceptance/logs/`
- [ ] Doxygen HTML generated and reviewed; warnings = 0
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect current state

### Code Quality Assessment

**STORY READINESS ASSESSMENT** - Story is in NotStarted status and not ready for implementation review.

**Current Status**: NotStarted - No implementation has been completed yet.

**Story Quality**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Critical quality assurance story with clear coverage and documentation requirements.

**Architecture Assessment**: ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY FOCUS**

- Clear focus on achieving ≥85% unit test coverage requirement
- Comprehensive acceptance testing validation on physical hardware
- Proper integration with company testing and documentation standards
- Well-defined quality gates and regression management
- Strong alignment with company SOP requirements

### Compliance Check

- **Story Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Complete story with all required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 critical quality ACs
- **Task Breakdown**: ✅ **PASS** - 4 focused quality tasks
- **Standards Alignment**: ✅ **PASS** - Proper reference to company standards

### Story Readiness Analysis

**Prerequisites for Implementation**:

1. ✅ Story structure complete and well-defined
2. ✅ Acceptance criteria clear and measurable (5 ACs)
3. ✅ Task breakdown focused on quality deliverables (4 tasks)
4. ⚠️ **DEPENDENCY**: Requires ALL previous Epic 0 stories to be completed
5. ❌ **BLOCKING**: Story status is NotStarted, not ready for development

**Implementation Readiness Score**: 60/100 (good planning, but depends on ALL other stories)

### Dependency Analysis

**CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES** - This is the FINAL Epic 0 story:

- **ALL Epic 0 Stories**: Must be completed before this quality validation story
- **Story 0.2**: HIL Test Harness with ≥90% unit test coverage
- **Story 0.3**: BDD Acceptance Testing Framework operational
- **Stories 0.4-0.8**: All hardware validation and testing stories completed

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK** - This story depends on successful completion of ALL other Epic 0 stories.

**Potential Risks**:
- **High**: Any blocking issues in previous stories will delay this story
- **High**: Achieving ≥85% coverage across all implemented functionality
- **Medium**: Acceptance test execution reliability on physical hardware
- **Low**: Doxygen documentation generation complexity

### Gate Status

Gate: **EPIC_COMPLETION_STORY** → docs/qa/gates/0.9-test-coverage-and-documentation.yml

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ EPIC COMPLETION DEPENDENCY** - This story should be the LAST Epic 0 story to be implemented.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Complete ALL other Epic 0 stories** first
2. **Achieve quality gates** for all previous stories
3. **Execute this story** as final Epic 0 validation
4. **Generate comprehensive Epic 0 completion report**
