## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **Test Framework**: Unity testing framework via PlatformIO
- **Test Location**: test/ directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 85% statement coverage required
- **Test Patterns**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for unit tests
- **HIL Integration**: Test hooks for hardware-in-the-loop validation

### Architecture Context

- **Build System**: PlatformIO with Arduino framework for ATmega32A
- **Target Hardware**: ATmega32A microcontroller (32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM)
- **Communication**: MODBUS RTU slave implementation
- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml as sole source of truth
- **Project Structure**: Follows Axovia Flow company standards

### Technical Constraints

- **Memory Limitations**: 32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM constraints
- **Real-time Requirements**: Cooperative scheduling, no RTOS
- **Industrial Standards**: Must support IEC 61131 compliance path
- **Safety Requirements**: SIL 2 certification preparation
- **Performance**: MODBUS response times ≤100ms

### File Locations

- **Source Code**: src/ (main firmware code)
- **Headers**: include/ (public headers and interfaces)
- **Tests**: test/unit/ and test/integration/
- **Documentation**: docs/ (architecture, user guides, API docs)
- **Configuration**: config/ (hardware config, build settings)
- **CI/CD**: .github/workflows/ (GitHub Actions)

### Previous Story Insights

- This is the foundational story - no previous story context
- Critical for all subsequent development
- Must establish quality standards from the beginning

## Change Log

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4 (James - Full Stack Developer)

### Debug Log References

- `markdownlint docs/stories/0.1.project-structure-cicd-pipeline.md` - Fixed
  MD013 line length and MD032 list spacing issues
- `make coverage` - Verified coverage target works correctly (✅ PASS)
- `make test-unit` - Validated unit testing pipeline (✅ PASS)

### Completion Notes List

1. **Status Change**: Updated story status from "Draft" to "In Progress" per
   QA gate recommendation
2. **Markdown Lint Fixes**: Resolved all MD013 line length violations and
   MD032 list spacing issues
3. **Coverage Target Verification**: Confirmed `make coverage` target exists
   and functions correctly
4. **Legacy File Check**: Verified only one hardware-config.yaml exists in
   correct location (config/)

### File List

- Modified: `docs/stories/0.1.project-structure-cicd-pipeline.md` (status
  change, markdown fixes, dev record)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**STORY READINESS ASSESSMENT** - Story is in Draft status and not ready for
implementation review.

**Current Status**: Draft - No implementation has been completed yet.

**Story Quality**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Well-structured story with comprehensive
acceptance criteria and detailed task breakdown.

**Architecture Assessment**: ✅ **STRONG FOUNDATION**

- Clear separation of concerns across 5 major task areas
- Comprehensive coverage of CI/CD pipeline requirements
- Proper integration with company standards and compliance
- Well-defined technical constraints and architecture context
- Excellent documentation of testing standards and file locations

### Compliance Check

- **Story Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - Complete story with all required sections
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **PASS** - 10 comprehensive ACs covering all aspects
- **Task Breakdown**: ✅ **PASS** - 5 major tasks with detailed subtasks
- **Technical Documentation**: ✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive dev notes and constraints

### Story Readiness Analysis

**Prerequisites for Implementation**:

1. ✅ Story structure complete and well-defined
2. ✅ Acceptance criteria comprehensive (10 ACs)
3. ✅ Task breakdown detailed and actionable (5 major tasks)
4. ✅ Technical constraints and architecture documented
5. ❌ **BLOCKING**: Story status is Draft, not ready for development

**Implementation Readiness Score**: 80/100 (excellent planning, awaiting
development start)

### Recommendations for Development Team

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:

1. **Change Story Status** from "Draft" to "In Progress" when development begins
2. **Assign Developer** to take ownership of implementation
3. **Create Development Branch** following company branching standards
4. **Begin Task 1** (Project Structure Setup) as foundation for all other
   tasks

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**:

- Task 1 must be completed first as it establishes foundation for all
  subsequent tasks
- CI/CD pipeline (Task 2) should be implemented early to enable automated
  testing
- Testing framework integration (Task 3) is critical for quality gates
- All tasks have dependencies that require sequential or parallel execution
  planning

### Risk Assessment

**LOW RISK** - Well-planned story with clear requirements and comprehensive
task breakdown.

**Potential Risks**:

- **Medium**: PlatformIO configuration complexity for ATmega32A target
- **Low**: GitHub Actions workflow configuration for embedded systems
- **Low**: Integration complexity between testing frameworks

### Gate Status

Gate: **PLANNING COMPLETE** →
docs/qa/gates/0.1-project-structure-cicd-pipeline.yml

### Recommended Status

**✅ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** - Story planning is complete and comprehensive.
Development team can proceed with implementation.

**Next Steps**:

1. Assign developer and change status to "In Progress"
2. Begin with Task 1: Project Structure Setup
3. Implement tasks sequentially with proper testing at each stage
4. Return for QA review when all tasks are completed and status is "Ready for
   Review"
