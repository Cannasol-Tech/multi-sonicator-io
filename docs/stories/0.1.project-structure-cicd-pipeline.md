## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

- **Test Framework**: Unity testing framework via PlatformIO
- **Test Location**: test/ directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 85% statement coverage required
- **Test Patterns**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for unit tests
- **HIL Integration**: Test hooks for hardware-in-the-loop validation

### Architecture Context

- **Build System**: PlatformIO with Arduino framework for ATmega32A
- **Target Hardware**: ATmega32A microcontroller (32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM)
- **Communication**: MODBUS RTU slave implementation
- **Hardware Config**: config/hardware-config.yaml as sole source of truth
- **Project Structure**: Follows Axovia Flow company standards

### Technical Constraints

- **Memory Limitations**: 32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM constraints
- **Real-time Requirements**: Cooperative scheduling, no RTOS
- **Industrial Standards**: Must support IEC 61131 compliance path
- **Safety Requirements**: SIL 2 certification preparation
- **Performance**: MODBUS response times ≤100ms

### File Locations

- **Source Code**: src/ (main firmware code)
- **Headers**: include/ (public headers and interfaces)
- **Tests**: test/unit/ and test/integration/
- **Documentation**: docs/ (architecture, user guides, API docs)
- **Configuration**: config/ (hardware config, build settings)
- **CI/CD**: .github/workflows/ (GitHub Actions)

### Previous Story Insights

- This is the foundational story - no previous story context
- Critical for all subsequent development
- Must establish quality standards from the beginning
