## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Sonicator Operator,
**I want** real-time WebSocket-based monitoring of all hardware states and system events with live updates,

2. Live pin state updates with <1 second latency for all monitored signals
3. Real-time connection status monitoring and automatic reconnection handling
4. Hardware event broadcasting (connect/disconnect/error/command responses)
5. Live test execution progress updates and result streaming
6. WebSocket message protocol with structured data formats and error handling
7. Client-side WebSocket management with automatic reconnection and error recovery
8. Real-time Arduino command logging with command/response pairing
9. Live monitoring dashboard with visual indicators for all system states
10. Performance optimization ensuring minimal latency and efficient data streaming

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Backend API (Story 3.2) provides foundation with existing WebSocket implementation
- Frontend (Story 3.1) has WebSocket client integration and real-time components
- Existing WebSocket infrastructure is functional but needs optimization for real-time monitoring
- Current implementation supports basic real-time updates but needs enhancement for comprehensive monitoring

### Architecture Context

**WebSocket Server Implementation**: Existing TypeScript WebSocket server with hardware integration [Source: web-ui/backend/src/websocket/WebSocketHandler.ts]
- WebSocket server with client connection management
- Hardware event listeners for real-time broadcasting
- Message protocol with structured data formats
- Test automation integration for live updates

**Real-time Message Protocol**: Structured WebSocket message types [Source: web-ui/frontend/src/types/index.ts]
- Message types: pin_update, connection_status, error, command_response, test_progress
- Timestamp synchronization for event ordering
- Type-safe message handling with TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling and message validation

**Hardware Event Broadcasting**: Real-time hardware state monitoring [Source: web-ui/backend/src/websocket/WebSocketHandler.ts]
- Pin state change detection and broadcasting
- Hardware connection/disconnection events
- Arduino command logging with command/response pairing
- Error event broadcasting and handling

**Client-side WebSocket Management**: React hook for WebSocket connection [Source: web-ui/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts]
- Automatic connection management and reconnection
- Message handling and state synchronization
- Error recovery and connection health monitoring
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts

### Technical Specifications

**WebSocket Server Configuration**:
- Endpoint: `ws://localhost:3001/ws` (configurable via environment)
- Connection management with client tracking
- Broadcast capabilities for all connected clients
- Hardware event listener integration

**Message Protocol Structure**:
```typescript
interface WebSocketMessage {
  type: 'pin_update' | 'connection_status' | 'error' | 'command_response' | 'test_progress' | 'test_complete' | 'arduino_command_sent' | 'arduino_command_response';
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

**Real-time Broadcasting Events**:
- Hardware connection/disconnection status
- Pin state changes with signal and value updates
- Arduino command execution and responses
- Test execution progress and results
- System errors and recovery events

**Performance Requirements**:
- Message latency: <1 second for all hardware state changes
- Connection recovery: Automatic reconnection within 5 seconds
- Bandwidth optimization: Efficient state change detection
- Client capacity: Support for multiple concurrent connections

### File Locations
- **WebSocket Server**: `web-ui/backend/src/websocket/WebSocketHandler.ts` (main WebSocket handler)
- **Message Types**: `web-ui/frontend/src/types/index.ts` (WebSocket message interfaces)
- **Client Hook**: `web-ui/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` (React WebSocket management)
- **Hardware Integration**: `web-ui/backend/src/adapters/HardwareInterface.ts` (hardware event source)
- **Frontend Components**: `web-ui/frontend/src/components/` (real-time monitoring UI)

### Testing Requirements
- **WebSocket Testing**: Jest for server-side WebSocket functionality
- **Real-time Testing**: Integration tests for live data streaming
- **Connection Testing**: Reconnection and error recovery validation
- **Performance Testing**: Latency and bandwidth optimization verification
