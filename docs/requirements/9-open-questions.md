# 9. Open Questions

*All initial open questions were resolved during the drafting of this PRD.*

* **Physical Constraints:** The physical footprint and power constraints are not a direct constraint on the firmware development at this time and will be handled by the hardware team.
* **PLC/HMI Error Codes:** No specific error codes are required by the PLC/HMI system beyond the defined `COMM_FAULT` flag.
* **Hot-Swapping Sonicators:** Hot-swapping units during operation is out of scope for this version of the firmware.
