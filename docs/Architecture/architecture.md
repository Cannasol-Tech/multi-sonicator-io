# Firmware Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the firmware architecture for the Multi Sonicator I/O Controller, designed to manage up to four CT2000 sonicators simultaneously.

## System Architecture

*[To be completed in Phase 2 - Hardware Interface Implementation]*

### High-Level Components

1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**
   - GPIO management
   - ADC interface
   - DAC communication
   - Signal isolation

2. **Communication Layer**
   - MODBUS RTU slave implementation
   - Register mapping
   - Protocol handling

3. **Control Logic**
   - Sonicator interface classes
   - Multi-unit orchestration
   - Safety monitoring

4. **System Services**
   - Diagnostics
   - Event logging
   - Performance monitoring
   - Firebase integration

## Module Structure

*[Detailed module breakdown to be added as development progresses]*

## Dependencies

- Arduino framework compatibility
- MightyCore board package
- Standard AVR libraries

## Design Principles

- Modular, reusable components
- Safety-first architecture
- Real-time responsiveness
- Maintainable code structure
