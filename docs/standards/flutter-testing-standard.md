# Flutter Application Testing Standard

> **Note:** This document defines the official testing standard for all Flutter applications within the organization.

## Overview

Flutter applications require specialized testing approaches due to their cross-platform nature and unique architecture. This standard defines the **official testing requirements** for all Flutter projects, emphasizing the use of Flutter's built-in testing framework with strict mocking limitations.

---

## Framework Requirements

### Primary Testing Framework
- **Foundation**: Flutter's built-in testing framework (`flutter_test`) for ALL Flutter testing
- **Coverage**: Widget tests, unit tests, golden tests (UI consistency), and integration testing foundation

### Mocking Framework (Unit Tests ONLY)
- **Standard**: Mocktail ^1.0.4 (OFFICIAL - no exceptions)
- **Scope**: **MOCKING IS ONLY TO BE USED FOR UNIT TESTING**
- **Prohibition**: Widget tests, integration tests, and golden tests must NOT use mocking
- **Rationale**: Mocking in non-unit tests defeats the purpose of testing real component interactions

### Specialized Frameworks
- **BLoC Testing**: `bloc_test` framework permitted when using BLoC pattern for business logic
- **Integration Testing**: Flutter's `integration_test` framework for end-to-end testing
- **Golden Testing**: Flutter's built-in golden test support for visual regression testing

### Testing Pyramid Distribution
- **Unit Tests**: 70% - Business logic, models, services, utilities
- **Widget Tests**: 20% - UI components, user interactions, widget behavior
- **Integration Tests**: 10% - Critical user flows, platform-specific features

---

## Framework-Specific Standards

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Framework**: `flutter_test` + `mocktail` (mocking permitted)
- **Coverage Requirement**: ≥85% statement coverage
- **Scope**: Business logic, data models, services, utilities
- **Mocking**: Permitted and encouraged for external dependencies
- **Location**: `test/unit/`

```dart
// Example: Unit test with mocking
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:mocktail/mocktail.dart';

class MockFirebaseAuth extends Mock implements FirebaseAuth {}

void main() {
  group('UserService Tests', () {
    late MockFirebaseAuth mockAuth;
    
    setUp(() {
      mockAuth = MockFirebaseAuth();
    });
    
    test('should authenticate user successfully', () async {
      // Arrange
      when(() => mockAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
        email: any(named: 'email'),
        password: any(named: 'password'),
      )).thenAnswer((_) async => mockUserCredential);
      
      // Act & Assert
      // Test business logic with mocked dependencies
    });
  });
}
```

### 2. Widget Testing
- **Framework**: `flutter_test` ONLY (NO mocking)
- **Coverage Requirement**: ≥70% widget coverage
- **Scope**: UI components, user interactions, widget rendering
- **Mocking**: **PROHIBITED** - Test real widget behavior
- **Location**: `test/widget/`

```dart
// Example: Widget test without mocking
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Login button triggers callback', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    bool callbackTriggered = false;
    
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      MaterialApp(
        home: LoginButton(
          onPressed: () => callbackTriggered = true,
        ),
      ),
    );
    
    await tester.tap(find.byType(ElevatedButton));
    expect(callbackTriggered, isTrue);
  });
}
```

### 3. Golden Testing (Visual Regression)
- **Framework**: Flutter's built-in golden test support
- **Scope**: Critical UI components, visual consistency across platforms
- **Mocking**: **PROHIBITED** - Test actual visual output
- **Location**: `test/golden/`

```dart
// Example: Golden test
testWidgets('Login page golden test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: LoginPage()));
  await expectLater(
    find.byType(LoginPage),
    matchesGoldenFile('golden/login_page.png'),
  );
});
```

### 4. Integration Testing
- **Framework**: Flutter's `integration_test` framework
- **Scope**: End-to-end user flows, platform-specific features
- **Mocking**: **PROHIBITED** - Test complete system integration
- **Location**: `integration_test/`

```dart
// Example: Integration test
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';

void main() {
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  testWidgets('Complete sign-in flow', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Test complete user journey without mocks
    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());
    
    // Navigate through actual app flow
    await tester.tap(find.text('Sign In'));
    await tester.enterText(find.byKey(Key('email')), 'test@example.com');
    // ... complete flow testing
  });
}
```

## Coverage Requirements

| Test Type | Minimum Coverage | Enforcement |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Unit Tests | 85% | CI/CD Pipeline |
| Widget Tests | 70% | CI/CD Pipeline |
| Integration Tests | Critical Paths | Manual Review |
| Overall Project | 80% | CI/CD Pipeline |

---

## Make Targets for Flutter

Flutter projects must implement these standardized make targets:

```bash
# Unit Testing (with mocking allowed)
make test-unit
# - Executes: flutter test test/unit/
# - Coverage: ≥85% requirement
# - Mocking: Mocktail permitted

# Widget Testing (no mocking)
make test-widget  
# - Executes: flutter test test/widget/
# - Coverage: ≥70% requirement
# - Mocking: PROHIBITED

# Golden Testing (visual regression)
make test-golden
# - Executes: flutter test test/golden/
# - Updates: flutter test --update-goldens (when needed)
# - Mocking: PROHIBITED

# Integration Testing (end-to-end)
make test-integration
# - Executes: flutter test integration_test/
# - Scope: Complete user flows
# - Mocking: PROHIBITED

# Complete Flutter Test Suite
make test
# - Executes all Flutter test types in sequence
# - Equivalent to: make test-unit && make test-widget && make test-integration
```

## Prohibited Practices

### Strictly Forbidden
- ❌ Using Mockito (use Mocktail exclusively)
- ❌ Mocking in widget tests (defeats purpose of UI testing)
- ❌ Mocking in integration tests (defeats purpose of E2E testing)
- ❌ Mocking in golden tests (defeats purpose of visual testing)
- ❌ Creating mocks outside centralized helpers
- ❌ Hardcoded test data (use centralized test_data.dart)

### Required Practices
- ✅ Use Flutter's built-in testing framework as foundation
- ✅ Use Mocktail exclusively for unit test mocking
- ✅ Centralize all mocks in `test/helpers/mocks.dart`
- ✅ Follow testing pyramid distribution (70/20/10)
- ✅ Maintain coverage requirements with CI/CD enforcement

---

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Platform-Specific Testing
- **iOS**: Test iOS-specific integrations (Sign in with Apple, etc.)
- **Android**: Test Android-specific features (back button behavior, etc.)
- **Web**: Test web-specific interactions and responsive design
- **Desktop**: Test desktop-specific UI patterns and interactions

### Test Execution Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Run on all platforms (business logic is platform-agnostic)
- **Widget Tests**: Run on primary platform with cross-platform validation
- **Integration Tests**: Run on each target platform separately
- **Golden Tests**: Generate and validate on each platform

---

## Quality Gates for Flutter

All Flutter stories must pass these quality gates:

- [ ] Unit tests achieve ≥85% coverage (mocking permitted)
- [ ] Widget tests achieve ≥70% coverage (NO mocking)
- [ ] Integration tests cover critical user flows (NO mocking)
- [ ] Golden tests validate UI consistency (NO mocking)
- [ ] All tests use Flutter's built-in testing framework

✅ **This standard is authoritative for all Flutter applications. Compliance is mandatory and enforced through CI/CD pipelines.**
