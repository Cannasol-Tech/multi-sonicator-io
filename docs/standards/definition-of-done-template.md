# Definition of Done (DoD) Template - MANDATORY QUALITY GATE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE

**THIS IS A MANDATORY QUALITY GATE - NO EXCEPTIONS**

- ‚ùå **BLOCKING**: Stories CANNOT be marked as "Done" without complete DoD validation
- ‚ùå **BLOCKING**: Stories CANNOT be merged without Test Architect DoD approval
- ‚ùå **BLOCKING**: Stories CANNOT be released without PASS quality gate status
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: All 7 DoD sections must be completed with evidence
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Test Architect must validate and create quality gate file

## Purpose

This template provides a **mandatory** standardized checklist for validating story completion according to company standards. **NO STORY** can be marked as "Done" without completing this checklist and receiving Test Architect validation.

## MANDATORY Usage Instructions - NO BYPASSING ALLOWED

1. **MANDATORY**: Copy this template into the story file under "## Definition of Done Checklist Completion"
2. **MANDATORY**: Complete each section systematically during story development
3. **MANDATORY**: Mark items as complete only when evidence exists
4. **MANDATORY**: Document evidence for each completed item
5. **MANDATORY**: Get Test Architect validation using `*review {story}` command
6. **MANDATORY**: Receive PASS quality gate status before marking story as "Done"

## ‚õî ENFORCEMENT RULES

### For Developers:
- **CANNOT** change story status to "Done" without complete DoD checklist
- **CANNOT** merge code without Test Architect DoD approval
- **MUST** provide specific evidence for every checklist item
- **MUST** request Test Architect review when DoD is complete

### For Test Architects:
- **MUST** validate every DoD checklist item before approval
- **MUST** create quality gate file using `*gate {story}` command
- **MUST** provide PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED decision with rationale
- **CANNOT** approve stories with incomplete DoD evidence

### For Project Managers:
- **CANNOT** accept stories as "Done" without Test Architect DoD approval
- **CANNOT** include stories in releases without PASS quality gate status
- **MUST** enforce DoD compliance across all development teams
- **MUST** track DoD compliance metrics in sprint reviews

## ‚õî MANDATORY QUALITY GATES - BLOCKING REQUIREMENTS

### üö´ STORY CANNOT BE MARKED "DONE" WITHOUT:

#### 1. Complete DoD Checklist ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY
- [ ] **DoD Compliance Verified**: Test Architect has validated ALL checklist items
- [ ] **Evidence Documented**: Specific evidence provided for every checklist item
- [ ] **Quality Gate Created**: Gate file created in `docs/qa/gates/` with PASS status
- [ ] **Traceability Verified**: All requirements mapped to tests with evidence
- [ ] **Risk Assessment Complete**: Risk profile documented and acceptable

#### 2. Test Architect Approval ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY
- [ ] **Test Architect Review**: `*review {story}` command executed by Test Architect
- [ ] **Quality Gate Status**: PASS (CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED require explicit approval)
- [ ] **QA Results Updated**: Comprehensive review results added to story file
- [ ] **Gate File Created**: Quality gate file exists in `docs/qa/gates/`

#### 3. Blocking Conditions ‚ö†Ô∏è AUTOMATIC FAILURE
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Any DoD checklist item incomplete or lacking evidence
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Test coverage below 85% requirement
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Quality gate status is FAIL without approved waiver
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: No Test Architect validation performed
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Critical security or performance issues unresolved

### üîí ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

#### Automated Checks (Future Implementation)
- **Pre-merge Hook**: Verify DoD checklist completion before code merge
- **Status Validation**: Block status change to "Done" without quality gate PASS
- **Release Gate**: Prevent release inclusion without DoD compliance

#### Manual Enforcement (Immediate)
- **Code Review**: Reviewers must verify DoD completion before approval
- **Sprint Review**: PM must validate DoD compliance before story acceptance
- **Release Planning**: Only stories with PASS quality gates included in releases
