# Definition of Done (DoD) Template

## Purpose

This template provides a standardized checklist for validating story completion according to company standards. All stories marked as "Done" must complete this checklist to ensure consistent quality and compliance.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** into the story file under "## Definition of Done Checklist Completion"
2. **Complete each section** systematically during story development
3. **Mark items as complete** only when evidence exists
4. **Document evidence** for each completed item
5. **Get Test Architect validation** before marking story as "Done"
