### Critical Coverage Analysis

**Full Coverage Achieved:**
All 5 acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage across appropriate test levels:

1. **Unit Level**: Pure logic validation for calculations and state management
2. **Integration Level**: Component interaction and data flow verification  
3. **HIL Level**: End-to-end hardware validation with real-world conditions

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability analysis:

1. **Current Coverage is Comprehensive**: All acceptance criteria fully covered
2. **Test Level Distribution Appropriate**: Good balance across unit/integration/HIL levels
3. **Hardware Validation Strong**: HIL tests provide real-world validation
4. **No Additional Tests Required**: Coverage meets all requirements

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: No requirements with missing coverage
- **Medium Risk**: No requirements with partial coverage  
- **Low Risk**: All requirements have full multi-level coverage

### Coverage Quality Indicators

✅ **Every AC has at least one test**: All 5 ACs covered
✅ **Critical paths have multiple test levels**: ACs 1, 2, 3, 4 have unit + integration + HIL
