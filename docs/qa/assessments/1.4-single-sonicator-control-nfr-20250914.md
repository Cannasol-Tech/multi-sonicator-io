Date: 2025-09-14
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Appropriate for industrial control system
- Performance: PASS - Meets <100ms MODBUS requirement with ±2% amplitude accuracy
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive state machine with proper error handling
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured modular code with excellent test coverage

## Critical Issues

None identified - all NFRs meet or exceed requirements.

## Assessment Details

### Security Assessment
**Status: PASS**
- No authentication required (appropriate for industrial control system)
- Input validation implemented for amplitude and control parameters
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Hardware isolation provides natural security boundary
- MODBUS RTU protocol security appropriate for industrial environment

### Performance Assessment  
**Status: PASS**
- MODBUS response times verified <100ms (meets requirement)
- Amplitude control accuracy ±2% (meets requirement)
- Memory usage at 74.8% (approaching limits but acceptable)
- State machine transitions optimized for minimal latency
- Real-time telemetry updates at 10Hz minimum

### Reliability Assessment
**Status: PASS**
- Comprehensive state machine with safety transitions
- Proper error handling and fault detection implemented
- Watchdog timer integration for system recovery
- Overload condition detection and response
- Graceful degradation on communication failures
- State persistence and recovery mechanisms

### Maintainability Assessment
**Status: PASS**
- Clean modular architecture with HAL abstraction
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration + HIL)
- Excellent documentation with hardware config traceability
- Clear separation of concerns across control layers
- Hardware-config.yaml as sole source of truth
- Professional code structure following company standards

## Quick Wins

- Memory usage monitoring: Add alerting at 80% threshold (~1 hour)
- Extended soak testing: 24+ hour validation (~4 hours)
- Performance profiling: Detailed timing analysis (~2 hours)

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority
- Monitor memory usage trends to prevent exhaustion
- Implement memory usage alerts and monitoring

### Medium Priority  
- Add state machine race condition testing
- Enhance error recovery testing scenarios

### Low Priority
- Consider memory optimization if usage grows
- Plan multi-channel testing when hardware available
