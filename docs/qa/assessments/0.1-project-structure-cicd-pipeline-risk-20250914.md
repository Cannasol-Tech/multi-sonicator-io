## Medium Risk Analysis

### 1. TECH-001: Root Directory Standard Violations

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Easy to accidentally add prohibited files to root
**Impact**: Medium - Could affect compliance and project maintainability
**Mitigation**:
- Implement automated root directory compliance checking in CI/CD
- Add pre-commit hooks to validate root directory structure
- Document standard clearly in README and development guidelines
- Regular compliance audits

**Testing Focus**: 
- Automated compliance validation in CI pipeline
- Pre-commit hook testing
- Root directory structure validation

### 2. OPS-002: CI/CD Pipeline Complexity

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Complex pipelines require ongoing maintenance
**Impact**: Medium - Pipeline failures could block development workflow
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive pipeline documentation
- Modular pipeline design for easier maintenance
- Regular pipeline performance review and optimization
- Backup/rollback procedures for pipeline changes

**Testing Focus**:
- Pipeline failure recovery testing
- Performance testing of build processes
- Integration testing across all pipeline stages

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests
- **Compliance validation**: Automated root directory structure checking
- **Pipeline resilience**: Test pipeline failure and recovery scenarios
- **Build process validation**: Test all make targets and build configurations

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests
- **Configuration drift detection**: PlatformIO settings validation
- **Artifact management**: Build output validation and storage testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Root directory compliance checking automated in CI/CD
- Pipeline failure recovery procedures documented and tested

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Manual monitoring of configuration drift acceptable initially
- Build artifact management can evolve with project needs

### Accepted Risks
- Some CI/CD complexity is inherent in comprehensive automation
- Configuration management overhead acceptable for quality benefits

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **CI/CD pipeline health**: Monitor build success rates and timing
- **Compliance violations**: Alert on root directory standard violations
- **Configuration drift**: Track changes to critical build configurations
- **Build performance**: Monitor build times and resource usage

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Major changes to CI/CD pipeline configuration
- New team members onboarded (training on standards)
- Build process or tooling changes
- Compliance requirements change
