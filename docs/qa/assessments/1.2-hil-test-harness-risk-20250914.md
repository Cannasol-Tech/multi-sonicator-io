## High Risk Analysis

### 1. OPS-001: Single-Channel HIL Limitation Affecting Validation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Current prototype is intentionally single-channel only
**Impact**: Medium - Limits comprehensive multi-channel system validation
**Mitigation**:
- Clearly document single-channel limitation in test results and reports
- Plan multi-channel harness expansion for comprehensive validation
- Implement simulation modes for multi-channel testing where possible
- Focus single-channel testing on comprehensive validation of architecture

**Testing Focus**: 
- Comprehensive single-channel validation to extrapolate multi-channel behavior
- Architecture validation to ensure scalability
- Simulation testing for multi-channel scenarios

## Medium Risk Analysis

### 2. TECH-002: Hardware Dependency for HIL Testing

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Physical hardware required for HIL validation
**Impact**: Medium - Testing blocked when hardware unavailable
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain backup hardware setups for critical testing
- Implement simulation fallback modes
- Document hardware setup and recovery procedures
- Cross-train team on hardware configuration

**Testing Focus**:
- Hardware setup automation and validation
- Fallback testing procedures
- Recovery and restoration testing

### 3. REL-003: Test Harness Hardware Failure Scenarios

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Hardware components can fail during testing
**Impact**: Medium - Testing interruption and potential data loss
**Mitigation**:
- Implement hardware health monitoring
- Regular calibration and maintenance procedures
- Backup harness configuration and quick setup procedures
- Graceful degradation when hardware issues detected

**Testing Focus**:
- Hardware failure detection and recovery testing
- Data preservation during hardware issues
- Quick restoration procedures validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **Multi-channel simulation**: Test architecture scalability through simulation
- **Single-channel comprehensive validation**: Exhaustive testing of available channel
- **Hardware availability procedures**: Test backup and recovery scenarios

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **Hardware dependency management**: Test simulation fallbacks and alternatives
- **Test harness reliability**: Hardware failure and recovery scenario testing
- **Setup automation**: Test hardware configuration and restoration procedures

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- **Serial communication stability**: Test communication error handling and recovery
- **Timing variation management**: Test execution timing consistency and tolerance

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Single-channel limitation properly documented and communicated
- Hardware failure detection and recovery procedures tested
- Backup testing procedures validated and documented

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Hardware dependency acceptable with proper backup procedures
- Serial communication issues manageable with error handling
- Timing variations acceptable within tolerance ranges

### Accepted Risks
- Single-channel limitation is acceptable for current development phase
- Hardware dependency is inherent to HIL testing approach
- Some timing variation is expected and manageable in test environment

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Hardware health metrics**: Monitor test harness component status
- **Test execution success rates**: Track HIL test reliability and consistency
- **Communication error rates**: Monitor serial communication stability
- **Hardware utilization**: Track usage patterns and maintenance needs

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Multi-channel harness becomes available for expansion
- Hardware failures or reliability issues encountered
- Test execution patterns or requirements change
- New HIL testing scenarios or capabilities added
