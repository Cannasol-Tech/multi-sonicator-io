## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-005: Memory Constraints at 74.8% RAM Usage

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Current usage approaching 75% threshold with potential for growth
**Impact**: High - Memory exhaustion could cause system instability or crashes
**Mitigation**:
- Monitor memory usage during extended testing scenarios
- Implement memory usage alerts in monitoring system
- Consider optimizing data structures if usage increases
- Review static vs dynamic allocation patterns

**Testing Focus**: 
- Extended runtime testing (24+ hour soak tests)
- Memory leak detection scenarios
- High-frequency operation stress testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **Memory stress testing**: Extended operation with memory monitoring
- **Resource exhaustion scenarios**: Test behavior at memory limits
- **Recovery testing**: System behavior after memory pressure

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests  
- **State machine transition testing**: Rapid start/stop cycle scenarios
- **Race condition detection**: Concurrent operation testing
- **MODBUS load testing**: High-frequency communication scenarios

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- **Pin mapping validation**: Hardware configuration verification
- **Multi-channel simulation**: Test framework capability testing
- **Performance edge cases**: Boundary condition validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Memory usage should not exceed 80% under normal operation
- No memory leaks detected during 24-hour testing
- State machine must handle all transition scenarios safely

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- HIL single-channel limitation acceptable for current prototype
- Pin mapping risks mitigated by hardware-config.yaml as sole source of truth
- MODBUS timeout risks acceptable with proper error handling

### Accepted Risks
- Single-channel HIL testing limitation is acceptable for current development phase
- Multi-channel testing deferred until hardware expansion available

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Memory usage metrics**: Track RAM utilization trends
- **MODBUS response times**: Alert on >100ms responses  
- **State machine errors**: Log all transition failures
- **System stability**: Monitor uptime and error rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Memory usage exceeds 80% 
- Multi-channel HIL harness becomes available
- Additional sonicator channels are implemented
- Performance requirements change
- New hardware configurations are introduced
