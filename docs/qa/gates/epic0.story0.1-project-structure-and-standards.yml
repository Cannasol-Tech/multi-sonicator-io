# QA Gate Decision for Story 0.1
story:
  id: "Story-0.1"
  epic: "Foundations"
  title: "Project Structure & Standards Compliance"
  report: "docs/agent-reports/story-0.1-completion-report.md"
  date_reviewed: "2025-09-10"
  reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

decision:
  status: PASS
  quality_score: 95
  rationale: |
    Story 0.1 delivers a compliant repository structure aligned with Axovia Flow standards,
    implements a comprehensive standards validation script, integrates the compliance gate into CI,
    and establishes a baseline unit test for standards verification. Evidence is well-documented in the
    completion report and corroborated by the presence of required directories and artifacts.

criteria_evidence:
  - name: Root directory compliance
    status: PASS
    evidence:
      - "LICENSE and .npmignore present"
      - "Only permitted root files maintained"
  - name: Core directory structure
    status: PASS
    evidence:
      - "docs/, src/, bin/ present"
      - "docs subdirectories created with README.md in each"
  - name: Standards validation system
    status: PASS
    evidence:
      - "scripts/sync_company_standards.py implements validation functions"
      - "make check-standards output shows PASS"
  - name: Unit testing baseline
    status: PASS
    evidence:
      - "test/unit/test_standards_compliance.cpp present"
  - name: CI integration
    status: PASS
    evidence:
      - ".github/workflows/ci.yml includes standards-compliance job"

risks:
  - id: LINT-01
    description: Markdown lint warnings in several docs may reduce doc quality signals in CI/reporting
    impact: Low
    mitigation: "Schedule documentation lint pass to fix MD031/MD032/MD040/MD046 warnings"

recommendations:
  - "Remove legacy hardware-config.yaml files now that config/hardware-config.yaml is centralized (approved by PO)"
  - "Add/verify a make coverage target producing a readable report and align with company standards"
  - "Extend standards unit tests to assert coverage target existence and basic output"
