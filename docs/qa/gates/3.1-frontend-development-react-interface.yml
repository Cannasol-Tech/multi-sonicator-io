# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Story 3.1 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with a complete React frontend
  that integrates well with the existing system. All major functional requirements are
  implemented and working. However, the test suite has critical failures (179 failing
  tests out of 468 total) that prevent confident production deployment.
  
  The implementation itself appears solid based on integration with Story 3.0, but
  the test failures indicate potential issues with component behavior, DOM handling,
  and test infrastructure that must be resolved before production readiness.
  
  CONCERNS gate allows development to continue while highlighting the critical need
  to address test quality before final deployment.

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  - "Address high-priority test failures in Header and TestResultsModal components"
  - "Investigate and fix DOM element setup issues in test environment"
  - "Run coverage analysis once tests are passing"
  - "Clarify authentication requirements with stakeholders"
  - "Re-evaluate for PASS gate once test issues resolved"
