# TODO — Story 0.4: Hardware Connection Verification (Developer Checklist)

Context
- Story: docs/agile/stories/0.4.hardware-connection-verification.md
- Gate: docs/qa/gates/0.4-hardware-connection-verification.yml (DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED, HIL waived)
- HIL Waiver: active (scope: hil) — proceed with pre‑HIL validation; defer hardware execution

How to Use
- Complete non‑hardware items now; keep HIL tests @pending with TODO notes.
- Run pre‑HIL checks in CI to detect drift and ensure readiness.

Checklist
1) Pin Matrix & Config (AC: 1, 9)
- [ ] Maintain pin matrix validator; run in CI against `config/hardware-config.yaml`
- [ ] Generate config report artifact and attach to CI runs

2) Scripts & Docs (pre‑HIL)
- [ ] Scaffold hardware verification scripts in `test/scripts/hardware/` (no device access)
- [ ] Prepare documentation stubs in `docs/hardware/` for connection diagrams and reports
- [ ] Add Make targets: `hardware-verify:pre` and CI wiring

3) Interface Suites (AC: 2, 3, 6, 10)
- [ ] Outline tests for DB9 sonicator interfaces, MODBUS, GPIO/ADC/PWM/UART
- [ ] Add mocks/sim where possible to validate procedure flow

4) Power & Safety Plan (AC: 4, 7, 8)
- [ ] Define power validation procedures and safety precautions
- [ ] Document emergency stop and fault detection test plans

5) Traceability & Reporting
- [ ] Ensure tests/docs reference `config/hardware-config.yaml` (SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- [ ] Prepare report templates under `test/reports/hardware/`

Notes
- Mark hardware steps @pending with TODO linking to this file until hardware is available.
