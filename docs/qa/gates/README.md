# 📋 QA Gates Directory

This directory contains Quality Assurance gate status files for all project stories, providing centralized quality tracking and validation status.

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**

QA Gates provide standardized quality checkpoints for each story, ensuring:
- **Code Quality**: Standards compliance and best practices
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds met
- **Acceptance Criteria**: All ACs validated and tested
- **Security Review**: Security considerations addressed
- **Performance**: Performance requirements validated
