# Quality Gate Decision for Story 0.4: Hardware Connection Verification
schema: 1
story: "0.4"
story_title: "Hardware Connection Verification"
gate: DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED
status_reason: "Excellent hardware verification planning but blocked by Story 0.2 HIL Test Harness completion and unit test coverage issues."
