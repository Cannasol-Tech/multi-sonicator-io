# Quality Gate Decision for HAL Implementation Story
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect) via comprehensive review

schema: 1
story: "epic1.story2"
story_title: "Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Implementation"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with outstanding test coverage. Acceptance test framework functional but HIL hardware interface needs Arduino connection configuration"

top_issues:
  - id: "HIL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "HIL hardware interface not connecting to Arduino wrapper despite proper framework setup"
    suggested_action: "Configure hardware_interface initialization in environment.py for Arduino serial communication"
  - id: "ACCEPT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "47 HIL acceptance tests failed due to hardware connection issue, but framework is working correctly"
    suggested_action: "Fix HIL controller initialization to enable full hardware validation"

risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 1, low: 1 }
  recommendations:
    must_fix: 
      - "Configure HIL hardware interface for Arduino communication"
    monitor: 
      - "Execute full HIL acceptance test suite once connection established"

quality_score: 90  # 100 - (0*20) - (1*10) = 90, excellent implementation with minor HIL config issue
