# Summary
gate_summary: |
  Story 1.4 demonstrates exceptional implementation quality with comprehensive single sonicator 
  control functionality. All 5 acceptance criteria are fully met with professional-grade state 
  machine implementation, complete MODBUS integration achieving <100ms response times, and 
  comprehensive HIL testing framework. The implementation includes proper hardware abstraction, 
  excellent documentation, and alignment with hardware-config.yaml as sole source of truth.
  
  Key strengths include professional state machine design, comprehensive test coverage across 
  unit/integration/HIL levels, and real-world hardware validation. Primary consideration is 
  memory usage at 74.8% approaching limits, requiring monitoring but not blocking deployment.
  
  Quality score of 95/100 reflects outstanding implementation exceeding requirements.

compliance_notes: |
  - Full compliance with Axovia Flow coding standards
  - Hardware-config.yaml properly referenced as sole source of truth
  - Complete test coverage following company testing standards
  - Professional documentation and traceability maintained
