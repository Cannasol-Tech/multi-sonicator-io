# Quality Gate Decision for Story 0.3: BDD Acceptance Testing
schema: 1
story: "0.3"
story_title: "BDD Acceptance Testing"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Duplication cleared; proceed with framework setup, PRD mapping, and CI wiring now. HIL execution deferred due to hardware availability (waived). See TODO."
