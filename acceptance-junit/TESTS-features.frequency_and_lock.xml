  Scenario Outline: Frequency and lock reflected within 100 ms -- @1.1 
    Given the HIL wrapper is connected and ready ... skipped in 0.000s
    And the DUT is powered and at safe defaults ... skipped in 0.000s
    Given unit 1 receives a frequency of 2000 Hz on the รท10 input ... skipped in 0.000s
    And unit 1 lock input is set to 1 ... skipped in 0.000s
    Then within 100 ms holding register 40017 is approximately 2000 Hz ... skipped in 0.000s
    And status flag bit2 for unit 1 equals 1 ... skipped in 0.000s
