  Scenario Outline: Frequency and lock reflected within 100 ms -- @1.1 
    Given the HIL wrapper is connected and ready ... passed in 0.001s
    And the DUT is powered and at safe defaults ... passed in 0.000s
    Given unit 1 receives a frequency of 2000 Hz on the ÷10 input ... passed in 0.001s
    And unit 1 lock input is set to 1 ... passed in 0.000s
    Then within 100 ms holding register 40017 is approximately 2000 Hz ... passed in 0.105s
    And status flag bit2 for unit 1 equals 1 ... passed in 0.000s

@scenario.end

Captured stdout:
✅ HIL wrapper assumed ready (simulation mode)
✅ DUT assumed powered and at safe defaults (simulation mode)
✅ Unit 1 frequency assumed set to 2000 Hz (HIL simulation)
✅ Unit 1 lock input assumed set to 1 (HIL simulation)
✅ Register 40017 frequency assumed correct: ~2000Hz (no MODBUS)
✅ Unit 1 status bit2 assumed as 1 (no MODBUS)
