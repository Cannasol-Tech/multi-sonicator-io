  Scenario: SC-025 CI drift check: PRD vs include/config.h
    Given the CI environment is configured ... skipped in 0.000s
    And the PRD requirements are documented in project-requirements.md ... skipped in 0.000s
    And the implementation constants are defined in include/config.h ... skipped in 0.000s
    When the CI drift check script runs ... skipped in 0.000s
    Then it should compare PRD requirements against implementation ... skipped in 0.000s
    And it should flag any mismatches between documentation and code ... skipped in 0.000s
    And it should block merge if critical drift is detected ... skipped in 0.000s
    And it should generate a drift report for review ... skipped in 0.000s
