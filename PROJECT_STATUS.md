Multi-Sonicator I/O â€” Project Status

- Last Updated: 2025-09-14
- Sources: `docs/agile/project-board.md`, `docs/agile/stories/STORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`, `docs/agile/epics/epic-roadmap.md`

Executive Summary
- Project Health: ðŸŸ¡ Active development
- Completion: 8% (2/25 stories completed)
- Focus: Finish Epic 0 foundation; maintain â‰¥85% unit test coverage per `docs/sop/sw-testing.md`
- Critical Path: 0.2 â†’ 0.3 â†’ 0.4â€“0.9 â†’ Epic 1

Whatâ€™s Done
- 0.1 Project Structure & CI/CD Pipeline â€” Completed, QA Gate PASS
- 1.2 HIL Test Harness â€” Completed, QA Gate PASS

In Progress / Under Review
- 0.2 HIL Test Harness Setup â€” Concerns: unit test coverage ~70% (<85% target)
- 3.0 Web UI Integration â€” Ready for review: 89.87% coverage (meets â‰¥85%)

Next Up (Unblockers First)
- Start 0.3 BDD Acceptance Testing Framework after 0.2 coverage fix
- Then 0.4â€“0.6 (Hardware Connection Verification, Arduino Test Wrapper Validation, Sandbox CLI Manual Testing)
- Prepare 3.1/3.2 (Frontend/Backend) after 3.0 finalizes
- Plan Epic 1 sequencing once Epic 0 foundation is complete (HAL and MODBUS focus)

Milestones
- M1: HIL Testing Infrastructure Complete (E-0) â€” Target Week 3
- M2: Single Sonicator Control (E-1) â€” Target Week 5
- M3: Web UI Operational (E-3) â€” Target Week 8
- M4: Multi-Unit Control (E-4) â€” Target Week 12
- M5: Production Ready (E-5) â€” Target Week 15

Quality & Gates
- Coverage Target: â‰¥85% unit tests (`docs/sop/sw-testing.md`)
- QA Gate Status:
  - Passed: 3 stories (0.1, 1.2, 3.0)
  - Concerns: 1 story (0.2 â€” coverage)
  - Failed: 0 stories

Risks & Blockers
- 0.2 coverage shortfall blocks 7 Epic 0 stories
- Dependency chain tightness in Epic 0; prioritize 0.2 â†’ 0.3 to unlock rest

Immediate Action Items (Next 2 Weeks)
- Raise 0.2 unit test coverage to â‰¥85% (1â€“2 days)
- Start 0.3 BDD framework after 0.2 is complete
- Prep Epic 1 planning (HAL and MODBUS) once Epic 0 is stable

Known Divergences To Reconcile
- Coverage threshold: AGENTS.md DoD says >85%; `docs/sop/sw-testing.md` now mandates â‰¥85%. Confirm AGENTS.md language aligns with the canonical SOP.
- Story status consistency:
  - Ensure story files and dashboards are synchronized for 0.2 and 3.0 after coverage updates.
