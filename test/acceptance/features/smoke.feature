Feature: Smoke
  Verify BDD harness and Arduino Test Wrapper can execute a passing test.

  Scenario: SMK-001 Harness runs a passing step
    Given the HIL test harness is connected
    Then the harness sanity check passes
    And the Arduino Test Wrapper is available for testing

  @smoke @web-ui @acceptance
  Scenario: SMK-002 Web UI Smoke Acceptance Test
    Given the web UI backend is running and healthy
    And the web UI frontend is accessible
    When I verify all Sonicator #4 pins are accessible
    Then all pin control APIs respond correctly
    And the frequency generation system is functional
    And the PWM monitoring system is operational
    And the theme toggle system works correctly
