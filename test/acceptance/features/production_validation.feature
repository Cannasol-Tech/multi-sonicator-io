    When I test watchdog timer functionality
    Then system resets should occur within specified timeouts
    When I test communication fault detection
    Then faults should be detected and handled appropriately

  @production @validation @modbus
  Scenario: MODBUS protocol compliance validation
    Given the system is configured for MODBUS testing
    When I test all supported MODBUS function codes
    Then function code 03 (Read Holding Registers) should work correctly
    And function code 06 (Write Single Register) should work correctly
    And function code 16 (Write Multiple Registers) should work correctly
    When I test error handling and exception responses
    Then illegal address exceptions should be handled correctly
    And illegal data value exceptions should be handled correctly
    And CRC errors should be detected and rejected

  @production @validation @interoperability
  Scenario: PLC integration validation
    Given the system is connected to a Velocio 1630c PLC
    When I configure the PLC for multi-sonicator operation
    Then the PLC should successfully communicate with the controller
    And all register mappings should work correctly
    And HMI integration should function properly
    And alarm handling should work as specified
    And data logging should capture all required parameters

  @production @validation @manufacturing

    Then all PCB traces should pass continuity testing
    And all component values should be within tolerance
    And all solder joints should pass inspection
    And firmware programming should complete successfully
    And calibration should be performed and verified
