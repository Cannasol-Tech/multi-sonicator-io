  # PRD ยง17 Risk - Automated validation of PRD vs implementation consistency

  Scenario: SC-025 CI drift check: PRD vs include/system_config.h
    Given the CI environment is configured
    And the PRD requirements are documented in project-requirements.md
    And the implementation constants are defined in include/system_config.h
    When the CI drift check script runs
    Then it should compare PRD requirements against implementation
    And it should flag any mismatches between documentation and code
    And it should block merge if critical drift is detected
    And it should generate a drift report for review
