Feature: Advanced Test Automation and Orchestration
  As a senior test engineer
  I want sophisticated test automation capabilities
  So that I can orchestrate complex testing workflows and optimize test execution

  Background:
    Given the advanced test automation interface is loaded
    And comprehensive test scenarios are available
    And the test orchestration engine is ready

  @test-suites @custom-suites
  Scenario: TAA-001 Create and manage custom test suites
    Given I have access to the test suite builder
    When I create a new custom test suite
    And I name it "Critical Hardware Validation"
    And I add scenarios with tags "@critical @hil @gpio"
    And I set the execution order to "dependency-based"
    And I configure retry policies for failed tests
    Then the custom suite should be saved
    And I should be able to execute it as a unit
    And dependencies should be respected during execution

  @scheduling @automated-execution
  Scenario: TAA-002 Schedule automated test executions
    Given the test scheduler interface is available
    When I create a new scheduled execution
    And I set the schedule to "Every day at 2:00 AM"
    And I select the "Nightly Regression" test suite
    And I configure email notifications for results
    And I set execution timeout to "2 hours"
    Then the schedule should be activated
    And tests should run automatically at the specified time
    And I should receive email notifications with results

  @parallel-execution @performance
  Scenario: TAA-003 Execute tests in parallel for faster completion
    Given a large test suite is selected for execution
    And parallel execution is enabled
    When I configure parallel execution with 4 workers
    And I start the test execution
    Then tests should run simultaneously on multiple workers
    And I should see multiple scenarios executing concurrently
    And the total execution time should be significantly reduced
    And results should be properly aggregated

  @dependency-management @test-ordering
  Scenario: TAA-004 Handle test dependencies and execution ordering
    Given scenarios with dependencies exist:
      | Scenario        | Depends On              |
      | HIL-CONFIG-001  | (none)                  |
      | HIL-GPIO-001    | HIL-CONFIG-001          |
      | HIL-PWM-001     | HIL-CONFIG-001, GPIO-001|
      | HIL-MODBUS-001  | HIL-CONFIG-001          |
    When I execute tests with dependency resolution
    Then tests should execute in the correct order:
      | Execution Order | Scenario        |
      | 1              | HIL-CONFIG-001  |
      | 2              | HIL-GPIO-001    |
      | 2              | HIL-MODBUS-001  |
      | 3              | HIL-PWM-001     |
    And dependent tests should wait for prerequisites
    And failure in prerequisite should skip dependent tests

  @retry-policies @resilience
  Scenario: TAA-005 Configure intelligent retry policies
    Given flaky test scenarios are identified
    When I configure retry policies:
      | Test Type       | Retry Count | Retry Delay | Conditions          |
      | Hardware Tests  | 3           | 30s         | Connection failures |
      | Communication   | 2           | 10s         | Timeout errors      |
      | Critical Tests  | 5           | 60s         | Any failure         |
      | Smoke Tests     | 1           | 5s          | Assertion errors    |
    And tests are executed with these policies
    Then failed tests should be automatically retried
    And retry attempts should be logged
    And final results should reflect retry outcomes

  @environment-management @test-data
  Scenario: TAA-006 Manage test environments and data sets
    Given multiple test environments are configured:
      | Environment | Hardware        | Configuration      |
      | DEV         | Arduino Uno R3  | Development setup  |
      | STAGING     | ATmega32A DUT   | Staging hardware   |
      | PROD        | Production HW   | Production config  |
    When I select different environments for execution
    And I configure environment-specific test data
    Then tests should execute with appropriate configurations
    And environment variables should be correctly set
    And test data should be environment-appropriate

  @load-testing @stress-testing
  Scenario: TAA-007 Perform load and stress testing via web UI
    Given load testing capabilities are available
    When I configure a load test with:
      | Parameter           | Value              |
      | Concurrent Users    | 10                 |
      | Test Duration       | 30 minutes         |
      | Ramp-up Period      | 5 minutes          |
      | Target Throughput   | 100 tests/hour     |
    And I start the load test execution
    Then the system should handle multiple concurrent executions
    And I should see load testing metrics
    And system performance should be monitored
    And bottlenecks should be identified

  @test-data-generation @parameterized-tests
  Scenario: TAA-008 Generate and use dynamic test data
    Given parameterized test scenarios exist
    When I configure test data generation:
      | Data Type        | Generation Rule         |
      | Pin Values       | Random HIGH/LOW states  |
      | Frequency Values | Range 18-22 kHz         |
      | Test IDs         | UUID v4 format          |
      | Timestamps       | Current system time     |
    And I execute tests with generated data
    Then each test run should use different data sets
    And data should meet specified constraints
    And test coverage should be maximized

  @api-integration @external-systems
  Scenario: TAA-009 Integrate with external test management systems
    Given external system integrations are configured:
      | System    | Integration Type | Purpose              |
      | TestRail  | REST API        | Test case management |
      | JIRA      | Webhook         | Issue tracking       |
      | Slack     | Bot integration | Team notifications   |
      | Jenkins   | Plugin          | CI/CD integration    |
    When test executions complete
    Then results should be automatically synced
    And external systems should be updated
    And notifications should be sent appropriately

  @custom-reporters @reporting-extensions
  Scenario: TAA-010 Create custom test result reporters
    Given the custom reporter interface is available
    When I create a custom reporter for "Management Dashboard"
    And I configure it to show:
      | Metric              | Format        | Update Frequency |
      | Overall Success Rate| Percentage    | Real-time        |
      | Critical Test Status| Pass/Fail     | Immediate        |
      | Execution Timeline  | Gantt Chart   | Every minute     |
      | Resource Usage      | Graphs        | Every 30s        |
    And I deploy the custom reporter
    Then the management dashboard should display live metrics
    And stakeholders should have access to relevant data

  @test-analytics @ml-insights
  Scenario: TAA-011 Analyze test patterns with machine learning
    Given historical test execution data is available
    And ML analytics are enabled
    When I run test pattern analysis
    Then I should see insights such as:
      | Insight Type        | Example Finding              |
      | Flaky Test Detection| HIL-GPIO-003 fails 30% randomly |
      | Optimal Execution Time| Best execution window: 2-4 AM  |
      | Failure Prediction  | Network tests likely to fail   |
      | Resource Optimization| Reduce parallel workers to 3   |
    And recommendations should be actionable
    And I should be able to implement suggested optimizations

  @security-testing @compliance
  Scenario: TAA-012 Perform security and compliance testing
    Given security testing modules are loaded
    When I configure security test scenarios:
      | Security Test Type    | Target           | Validation         |
      | Authentication Tests  | Web UI Login     | Access controls    |
      | Authorization Tests   | API Endpoints    | Permission checks  |
      | Input Validation      | Form Inputs      | Injection attacks  |
      | Data Protection       | Test Results     | PII handling       |
    And I execute the security test suite
    Then security vulnerabilities should be identified
    And compliance reports should be generated
    And remediation guidance should be provided
