### `executive-report.json`
- **Purpose**: Executive summary of unit test results only (CI pipeline)
- **Format**: JSON (machine-readable)
- **Contains**: Unit test scenarios, coverage validation, requirements mapping
- **Usage**: CI/CD pipeline consumption, dashboard integration

### `executive-report.md`
- **Purpose**: Human-readable unit test summary
- **Format**: Markdown
- **Contains**: Unit test results, coverage percentage, module breakdown
- **Usage**: PR reviews, development team updates

### `unit-test-summary.json`
- **Purpose**: Detailed unit test results and coverage data
- **Format**: JSON (machine-readable)
- **Contains**: Test suites, coverage metrics, module-specific results
- **Usage**: Coverage tracking, test result analysis

### `coverage-summary.json`
- **Purpose**: Coverage metrics summary
- **Format**: JSON (machine-readable)
- **Contains**: Line coverage, branch coverage, file-level details
- **Usage**: Coverage tracking, quality gate validation

## Manual Testing Reports

Generated after manual acceptance test execution:

### `acceptance-report.json`
- **Purpose**: Results from manual acceptance test execution
- **Format**: JSON (machine-readable)
- **Contains**: BDD scenario results, HIL test outcomes, requirements validation
- **Usage**: Release validation, quality assurance
- **Note**: Created manually after running `make test-acceptance`

### `executive-report-complete.json`
- **Purpose**: Combined unit + acceptance test results
- **Format**: JSON (machine-readable)
- **Contains**: Complete test suite results, quality gate status
- **Usage**: Release readiness assessment, stakeholder reporting
- **Generated by**: `make generate-complete-executive-report`

### `executive-report-complete.md`
- **Purpose**: Human-readable complete test summary
- **Format**: Markdown
- **Contains**: Release readiness assessment, quality gates, test breakdown
- **Usage**: Release documentation, stakeholder reviews

## Usage Instructions

### For CI Pipeline (Automated)
```bash
# Run complete CI pipeline
make ci

# Generates: executive-report.json, unit-test-summary.json, coverage-summary.json
```

### For Manual Testing (Release)
```bash
# 1. Run unit tests (if not already done)
make ci

# 2. Run acceptance tests manually with hardware
make test-acceptance

# 3. Generate complete executive report
make generate-complete-executive-report

# Generates: executive-report-complete.json, executive-report-complete.md
```

### For Release Preparation
```bash
# Complete test suite for release
make test  # Includes unit + acceptance + integration

# Generate all reports
make generate-complete-executive-report

# Upload final/ directory contents to GitHub release
```

## Report Consumption

### Dashboard Integration
- Use `executive-report.json` for automated dashboard updates
- Use `coverage-summary.json` for coverage trend tracking
- Use `unit-test-summary.json` for detailed test metrics

### Human Review
- Use `executive-report.md` for quick unit test status
- Use `executive-report-complete.md` for release readiness assessment

### Quality Gates
- Unit test coverage: `coverage-summary.json` → `totals.lines.pct >= 90`
- Test pass rate: `executive-report.json` → `summary.passed/summary.total >= 0.95`
- Release readiness: `executive-report-complete.md` → Quality Gates section
