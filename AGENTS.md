# AI Coding Agent Instructions for Multi-Sonicator-IO
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
## Purpose
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
Ensure AI Coding Agents consistently follows our house rules and repository standards for the multi-sonicator-io project.

## Flow Config Location
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
```yaml
axoviaFlowConfig:
  filePath: ".agile-flow/flow-config.yaml"
  description: "Agile Flow™ Config File intended to extend The BMad Core config"
  when_to_use: "Always"
```
## Source of Truth Hierarchy
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
1. **Primary standards**: `docs/sop/` (single source of truth)
2. **Architecture docs**: axoviaFlowConfig.filePaths.architecture.shards
3. **Project-specific**: This `AGENTS.md` file
4. **Project-specific**: axoviaFlowConfig.filePaths.company_standards
5. **Legacy standards**: `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (only when not in conflict)

> **Note**: If standards are duplicated elsewhere, treat `docs/sop/*` as canonical. Flag any divergence and propose sync PRs.

## SOP Index (Authoritative References)
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- Human index: `docs/sop/README.md` (single, canonical entry point for SOPs)
- Machine index: `.agile-flow/flow-config.yaml` → `standard_operating_procedures`

Agents should defer to these indices for specific file paths, thresholds, and report formats rather than duplicating details here. If an inconsistency is found, prefer `docs/sop/*` and open a sync PR.
## Decision Hierarchy (highest to lowest priority)
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
0. The Agile Flow framework flow config (`.agile-flow/flow-config.yaml`)
1. This instructions file (`AGENTS.md`)
2. `docs/sop/*` in this repo
3. `docs/architecture/*` and PRD docs
4. `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (only when not conflicting)

## Coding & Architecture Standards

### Code Quality
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- **Modular Design**: Write modular, object-oriented code with single responsibility per class/function
- **DRY Principle**: Avoid duplication; centralize shared logic in reusable modules/services
- **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative source for configuration, constants, and policies
- **Documentation**: Use doxygen-style comments for public interfaces and important modules
- **Architecture Changes**: Before making architecture-level changes (new modules/services, cross-cutting patterns), pause and request user approval with a brief plan/diagram

### Code Structure  
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
```markdown
- One clear, distinct purpose per function
- Centralized services/modules for shared functionality
- Clean architecture with easily accessible components
- Reusable functions and classes
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Definition of Done

- Unit Tests must be completed for all newly implemented features
- Unit Test Coverage must be ≥85% statement coverage (per SOP)
- Unit Test Coverage must be neatly displayed in the test report after running make test-unit
- The test report must follow the standards listed in `docs/sop/sw-testing.md` and `docs/sop/release-format.md`
- The feature must be verified through Acceptance BDD Tests with scenarios that are neatly mapped to PRD Requirements.
- The Acceptance BDD Tests must be run through the make target: make test-acceptance
- The Acceptance BDD Test Report must follow the standards listed in `docs/sop/sw-testing.md` and `docs/sop/release-format.md`
- The new functionality must be triple-checked for any code duplication or integration issues with existing systems.
- Regression: All previously written tests should pass after the new functionality is implemented.
- Previously written tests that are failing after the new feature has been implemented should be elevated to Project Management's attention by creating a file in the repository called `REGRESSION-ISSUES.md` which should clearly outline which tests are now failing and why they are failing.  The file should also outline potential solutions to fix the issues with pro's and cons for each solution clearly listed.

### Testing Standards
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- All tests should be run solely by make targets as defined in the Company's Software Testing Standards!
- Follow testing guidance in `docs/sop/sw-testing.md`
- Enforce coverage thresholds as defined in canonical standards
- For conflicts between testing standards, prefer `docs/sop/` and report deltas
- **Verification Requirement**: For every code change, add/update tests until behavior is verified
- Prefer fast, deterministic tests
- Provide test plans and execution commands

### Quality Gates
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- All code must be tested before delivery
- Never deliver untested functionality
- Always verify added code works through comprehensive testing
- Unit Test Coverage must exceed 85% for all newly implemented features

## Tooling & Safety 
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- Always use your task manager for all tasks - even when a single task is only required, use the task manager.
- When working, create a task list using your task manager for all tasks to be completed at all times.
- Be consistent with updating your task list using your task manager tool.
- The task manager should be utilized and kept up to date whether working on a single test or a large feature with many tasks.  Using the task manager helps increase visibility for project management and alignment between Agents and Project Managers.

### Dependency Management 
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- **Use Package Managers**: npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/poetry, cargo, go mod, etc.
- **Never Hand-Edit**: Do not manually edit lockfiles or package configuration files
- Let package managers handle version resolution and dependency conflicts

### Safety Practices
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- Show diffs before writing files
- Ask permission before executing commands or modifying files
- Prefer the smallest, safest change that satisfies requirements
- Use appropriate tools for external resource access
- Use GitHub tool for all GitHub interactions

## Documentation & Process

### Documentation Updates
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- Update implementation-plan documents when tasks complete
- Keep README/Usage examples current when CLI or developer UX changes
- Maintain doxygen comments for documentation generation

### Communication
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- **Ask Questions**: Never hesitate to ask for clarification
- Ensure alignment on project vision and approach
- **Suggest Improvements**: Propose better solutions when identified
- **Include URLs**: When requesting items from humans, include step-by-step instruction URLs

## Decision Making

### When Unsure

- Ask for clarification with 1-3 options and a recommendation
- Ensure we're on the same page before proceeding
- Get architecture decisions approved before implementation

### Improvement Mindset
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- Suggest more efficient, cheaper, or better solutions
- Engage in conversations about approaches
- Challenge approaches constructively when beneficial

## Project-Specific Guidelines -- Multi Sonicator IO (a.k.a Sonicator Multiplexer)

### Multi-Sonicator-IO Focus
<!-- Generated by ~•Axovia•ƒløw™•~ Agentic Framework -->
- Always reference `config/hardware-config.yaml` as the single SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the pin assignments and connections between the Arduino Test Wrapper and the ATMEGA32A Sonicator Multiplexer DUT.
- Understand the sonicator control and monitoring requirements
- Follow embedded systems best practices where applicable
- Maintain real-time performance considerations
- Ensure hardware interface reliability
- Web User Interface should be implemented for functionality and be as simple as possible while being an effective tool for testing the ATMEGA32A Sonicator Multiplexer DUT.

### DB9 Topology (Clarity for All Agents)

The DUT PCB routes five DB9 connectors that interface with external systems. During HIL, the Arduino Test Wrapper simulates/observes these exact signals.

```
CT2000 #1  CT2000 #2  CT2000 #3  CT2000 #4
    │           │           │           │
  DB9-1      DB9-2      DB9-3      DB9-4     ←→  PCB Traces  ←→  ATmega32A (DUT)  ←→  DB9-0 / DB9-5  ←→  Main Automation (MODBUS)

[HIL] Arduino Test Wrapper drives/reads DB9-equivalent signals per config/hardware-config.yaml
```

Authoritative mapping lives in `config/hardware-config.yaml` under `db9_connectors` and `dut.pins`. All validation, tests, and documentation must align to this file.
